Early in his career, he was labelled as a Pop artist, but his path has been so quirky and idiosyncratic, and his work at times so preoccupied with political themes, that he has never properly fitted into Richard Hamilton’s famous summary of Pop Art as ‘Popular / Expendable / Low Cost / Mass Produced / Young / Witty / Sexy / Gimmicky / Glamorous / Big Business’.

Coming from a large working-class family in Norwich, Self studied at the Norwich School of Art and the Slade School (1961–3). Pop Art represented for him ‘both a specifically working-class rebellion against obscurantism’ and ‘the first movement for goodness knows how long, to accept and reflect the world in which it lives’.1

A long visit to the USA in 1965, in particular his reaction to New York, fostered a new nuclear theme in Self’s work, notably in his Fallout Shelter drawings. However, it was while he was in Santa Monica, California, together with David Hockney, Patrick Prockter, and Norman Stevens, that he conceived the idea of Beach Girl, a sculpture of a young woman as a charred corpse, dead on a beach as a result of a nuclear explosion. He worked on this theme in 1966 following his return to Britain, and the principal picture is now in the Imperial War Museum. Self’s preoccupation had its roots in his adolescence, as he later explained:

I spent my teenage years … having been psychologically devastated by the preachings of Bertrand Russell and thought Armageddon would have exploded its nuclear end when he predicted. By 1967 or 8. For seven years I worked towards that end, thinking the most civilised thing we could do (with what time was left) would be a ‘record’ of ‘how come’ the world ended? 2

The four studies for Victims of Hiroshima were executed at much the same time, and were based on photographs of casualties of the Hiroshima bombing in 1945. Instead of the glamorous female icons so familiar from glossy magazines and typical of Pop Art, Self presents us with images of appallingly mutilated women, the victims of nuclear warfare. HD"

© David Hockney",Literature: Brown (2013) no. 71,"Picasso’s death in April 1973 may have inspired Hockney to create this wonderfully fluid line drawing a few months later by way of homage, reigniting the admiration he had felt for Picasso’s work at the Tate Gallery retrospective exhibition of 1960. An etching of similar date, Artist and Model (1973–4), shows a naked Hockney sitting opposite the Spanish master across a table, using spare, clean lines akin to those employed in this portrait of Henry Geldzahler (1935–1994), art critic and curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Andy Warhol first introduced the young Hockney to Geldzahler in 1963. They became close friends, staying together while on holiday in the summer of 1973 at a villa in Lucca. Hockney produced a number of drawings of Henry in the 1970s, many in pared-down style, showing him in relaxed poses – lounging with his leg over a tubular modern chair, sitting cross-legged on a sofa smoking a cigar, or buried deep in an armchair reading a book. He is most often shown with one leg crossed over the other, as here, in what must have been a characteristic posture.1

Flowing over the sheet with apparently effortless control, Hockney’s fine pen line is economical and elegant. Longer phrasing lines contrast with short, staccato strokes in the hair and beard, with repeated rhythmical striping in the T-shirt and chair seat. The barest indications suggest a spatial context – a diagonal bottom left and two vertical lines framing Henry’s profile – while the curlicue of Henry’s bottom lip is wittily repeated in his slightly bulging waistline, as well as in the typewriter and carving of the chair and table leg. Hands raised above the keyboard in a moment of thought or suspended animation, Henry is recorded in the process of creating Hockney on Hockney, first published in 1976. His body appears in repose while his mind is clearly in motion.

Although Hockney is famed for experimenting with bold colour, he has always practised draughtsmanship as a disciplined exercise in observing and recording. This may reflect his early training at the Royal College of Art (1959–62). Following a minor stroke, Hockney has recently returned once again to drawing, using charcoal rather than pen and ink as a medium. In an exhibition catalogue of 2014 he emphasises his continuing loyalty to the use of black and white on paper: ‘The Chinese say black and white contains colour, and so it can.’ Declaring that his stroke has not affected his ability to draw, but has made him concentrate all the more, he writes, ‘I’m OK so long as I can draw’.2 CP"

Carlisle (2001) no. 108","Although he studied at St Martin’s School of Art (1948–52) and then at the Royal College of Art (1952–5), Auerbach learnt most from the weekly life classes held by David Bomberg at the Borough Polytechnic. Like Bomberg himself, Auerbach began to draw in charcoal on large sheets of paper, working quickly because the models did not hold their poses for long periods. Since then, he has worked obsessively, for ten hours a day, every day of the week, his only interruptions being a weekly visit to the National Gallery. His range of subjects is deliberately limited, the majority being portraits of sitters familiar to him, and landscapes near his studio in Camden Town. Auerbach has intently studied a succession of models, the principal being Estella Olive West (EOW) from 1948 to 1973, his cousin, Gerda Boehm, and Julia Yardley Mills. In the late 1970s, he began to use other models, sometimes for only one or two works, often for a long series. One constant presence has been that of Julia Wolstenholme, whom he met when they were studying at the Royal College of Art; they were married in 1958.

Robert Hughes has vividly described Auerbach’s working method when drawing a portrait. He habitually uses two sheets of stout paper glued together, pinned to an easel.

As he scribbles and saws at the paper, the sticks of willow charcoal snap; they make cracking sounds like a tooth breaking on a bone. When he scrubs the paper with a rag clouds of black dust fly … The studio is like a colliery; the drawing easel is black and exquisitely glossy from years of carbon dust mixed with hand-grease.

As the portrait develops, sometimes over a period of weeks, ‘the creature will mutate, becoming dense and troll-like one day and dissolving in furioso passages of hatching the next’ but ‘in the end, the likeness is retrieved, but as a ghost, the colour of very tarnished silver’.1

Auerbach worked on this portrait of Julia over many sittings, adding and subtracting lines in charcoal and chalk not simply to create a likeness of his wife, but to capture her character, and only with the final thick strokes emphatically defining her hair, face, and neck. It was one of the representative collection of 40 works by the artist owned by his friend, the painter Lucian Freud (1922–2011), which has recently been distributed to museums and galleries throughout the United Kingdom."

DACS 2015",,"Tom Phillips first turned to portrait painting in the 1980s, and in 1992–3 created several portraits of the author Sir Salman Rushdie (b. 1947), partly in response to the fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini following publication of his controversial novel, The Satanic Verses (1988).1 A large head-and-shoulders lithograph of Rushdie bears an ancient cuneiform inscription which translates as ‘How can we say what blasphemy is; we do not know the thoughts of the Gods’.2 A further lithograph (fig. 65) shows Rushdie wearing a T-shirt emblazoned ‘JACK HUGHES’, standing before a portrait of Captain Dreyfus, the falsely imprisoned Jewish army officer famously defended in Emile Zola’s letter ‘J’accuse’ (1898).

In this, the most powerful of the portraits, Rushdie’s image is almost obliterated by the scratched lines and savagely overlaid marks of charcoal, pastel and thick black paint. Over the surface is spattered red-brick mud – a novel drawing medium. It is dripped in trails and smeared across the paper in a manner reminiscent of Jackson Pollock. The inscription on the portrait is taken from Rushdie’s poem entitled ‘6 March 1989’, the date of the fatwa, first published in Granta (autumn 1989): ‘Still, nameless-and-faceless or not, here’s my choice: / not to shut up. To sing on’.

The second verse of the poem describes the imagined violence done to Rushdie’s face by his attackers, who have poked out his eyes and knocked out his teeth so he can barely recall how his face used to look. Phillips’s drawing expresses the anger of this poem, conveying the damage done to Rushdie’s image by his detractors while endorsing his right to speak out against the ‘mud-slinging’. Despite the artist’s ‘attack’ on his subject, employing all the media he can throw at him, the face remains recognisably that of Rushdie, stoically enduring the onslaught.

In his description of the sittings for these portraits, however, Phillips appears far from angry. He remembers Rushdie as ‘a fearsome table-tennis opponent’ rather than as a tortured man of letters, despite his virtual house arrest while confined under police protection.3 Rushdie and Phillips collaborated on a limited edition artist’s book entitled Merely Connect (1993), which incorporated some of these wittily defiant political portraits.

Brown (1982) no. 59","According to George Vertue, Barlow had originally intended to become a portrait painter, but quickly realised that ‘his fancy did not lye that way, his Genious leading him wholly to drawing Fowl, Fish, and Beasts’.1 By 1656 he was described by the diarist John Evelyn as ‘the famous Paynter of fowle, Beastes and Birds’.2 Barlow was the first British-born specialist in this genre, though better known for drawings and prints than for oil paintings. His work was based on a long and scientific study of his animal subjects, and an exceptional familiarity with their behaviour and environment. He was nevertheless aware of his predecessors, and used their prints for more exotic animals, specimens of which were not available in London. Among his series of prints of birds, only one seems to have been engraved by Barlow’s own hand, the grandiosely entitled Multae et diversae avium species multifarijs formis et pernaturalebus figures (reprinted in 1671). Similar collections of his drawings engraved by other artists circulated widely.

Barlow’s most celebrated plates are the illustrations to the perennially popular Aesop’s Fables, which he published in his own edition of 1666. In contrast to earlier artists such as Francis Cleyn (c. 1582–1658), Barlow shows an extraordinary naturalism in his approach; his animals dominate the composition rather than being incidental, while the backgrounds are integral and convincing. The plates were so successful that when he came to publish a third, expanded edition of his Aesop Paraphras’d (1651, 1665), John Ogilby enlisted Barlow’s help.

This drawing of The Fox and the Eagle was one of several that Barlow provided for the Aesopics of 1668. It takes up his composition from the edition of 1666, but in an upright rather than a horizontal format. An eagle has carried off a fox cub to feed to her chicks, while the vixen, carrying a lighted brand, stands on a high branch of a tree, preparing to set fire to the nest. In the background, the episode is echoed several times with variations: another eagle attacks a fox’s lair, a second fox carries an eagle in its teeth, and a third howls at an eagle perched out of reach. Like most of Barlow’s drawings for illustrations, it is drawn with a quill pen in brown ink over graphite underdrawing, with diluted grey ink added to convey light and shade. The heavy and rather hard outlines were intended to facilitate the task of the engraver, in this case Richard Gaywood. CH"

(1987) no. 110","Political cartoons were published regularly in England in the seventeenth century, but were usually made by untrained artists with no great technical skill. Barlow was the first major artist to turn his hand to the genre, but only three of his designs survive, of which this is the most elaborate. The drawing is prepared for engraving as a large broadside, but seems never to have been published.

The subject has been convincingly interpreted by Hodnett. It refers to the extensive territorial conflicts which were resolved by the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1679. On the left is an ape intended for the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, riding a bear. He is accompanied by his monkey attendant, ‘major Likterncher’, representing Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Opposing him in this mock joust is the French king, Louis XIV. He is personified as an ape riding a boar, with the fleur de lys on his shield and the Gallic cock on the boar’s armour. The king is attended by ‘Captayne Suckplume’, probably Charles II of Great Britain and an ally of the French. Above the Emperor is an owl blowing a horn, to which is attached a banner bearing a pair of crossed artichokes. Above Louis XIV is a snipe with a different horn, and a banner emblazoned with three mushrooms. The birds represent the Papacy (with reference to the crossed keys of St Peter) and Charles XI of Sweden (the three crowns being an emblem of Sweden and referring to the united kingdoms of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark). In 1678–9, at the conclusion of a series of wars, Louis XIV formally ceded Lorraine, symbolised by the apple that is the object of this joust, to the Holy Roman Empire. In other contemporary treaties France gained possession of the Franche Comté and Artois from Spain, and ceded Maastricht to the Dutch Republic. Iconographically, Barlow’s cartoon is indebted to Aesop’s fable of the kite, the frog, and the mouse.

The circumstances of the commission of this drawing are not known. However, Barlow’s patron, William Cavendish, later 1st Duke of Devonshire, had succeeded in 1677 in persuading Charles II to withdraw British troops from supporting the French, and the cartoon may have been made at his behest. CH"

Beetles (2013) pp. 32–3","Gillray was the first political caricaturist in Britain. The son of a member of the Moravian Brethren, who believed in the essential depravity of existence, he maintained a misanthropic attitude to life, and a keen interest in politics. As a draughtsman, he was so precocious that he was already able to support himself by selling caricatures while studying at the Royal Academy Schools.

Like many in Britain, Gillray initially welcomed the outbreak of the French Revolution and the downfall of Louis XVI in 1789, producing a print entitled France Freedom, Britain Slavery. As atrocity succeeded atrocity, however, his attitude changed completely, and from 1791 the French became the targets for some of his most ferocious caricatures. Following the execution of Louis XVI in 1793, Gillray reserved his greatest animosity for the sans-culottes and their supporters, among whom he counted Charles James Fox. Even before France declared war on Britain in February 1793, Gillray attacked Fox as a regicide and traitor. The fall of Fox gave way in Gillray’s repertoire to the rise of Napoleon. Little Boney was to become one of his greatest creations: small, haggard, manic, and almost insane.

In 1798 Sir John Dalrymple of Cousland (1726–1810), an enthusiastic but rather ineffectual Scottish writer, published a prospectus advertising a series of caricatures illustrating The Consequences of the French Invasion, in the hope of attracting funding from the government. His intention was to ‘rouse all the People to an active Union against that Invasion; at a time when about five Millions of Cultures, with Beaks and Claws, hover over them; and when the Indolence and Divisions of the people themselves are more alarming than all foreign Enemies’. Two years earlier, Gillray’s companion, Mrs Humphrey, had already published his print of Promis’d Horrors of the French Invasion, or, Forcible Reasons for negotiating a Regicide Peace, against the proposed peace treaty with the revolutionary government. Now he provided plates showing the French instructing the House of Lords, the House of Commons, and the peasantry in their iniquitous ways.1 The present drawing, in Gillray’s most vigorous style, depicts two bloodthirsty French soldiers ejecting a priest from his church; a third stamping on a pile of crucifixes and mitres, while a judge looks on with approval. Dalrymple admired Gillray’s drawing, telling him that ‘The Irish Roman Catholic one is excellently executed & will do Good in Ireland in opening the eyes of these poor people’.2 Unfortunately, the British government did not agree, and the series was discontinued with only four plates completed.

Brown (1982) no. 1620","For most of his professional life, Rowlandson loved ridiculing the French. He first visited France in 1774, while still a student at the Royal Academy Schools, and returned several times in the 1780s. His caricatures mocked all aspects of French life, from royalty to beggars, with favourite targets being the military and the clergy, as well as the eating habits of all classes.

Napoleon was an obvious target for an English caricaturist, but Rowlandson did not begin drawing him in earnest until he had himself crowned as Emperor of France in 1804. Thereafter, Napoleon’s tribulations and foibles became frequent subjects. In one of Rowlandson’s most memorable works, published in 1808, Napoleon is portrayed as the ‘Corsican spider’, sitting in the middle of his web waiting for all the countries of Europe to become ensnared. Elsewhere, he appears as the Corsican bloodhound, the Corsican toad, or the Corsican Munchausen. Increasingly, he was accompanied by a skeleton personifying Death; the two appear to great effect in Nap and his Friends in their Glory, with Joseph Bonaparte and the Devil drinking a toast of ‘success to plunder and massacre’. Five years later Napoleon and Death appeared sitting disconsolately on the battlefield under the title The Two Kings of Terror.1 With great relish, Rowlandson drew caricatures of each episode of Napoleon’s discomfiture.

Following a succession of defeats by the Allied Coalition, Napoleon was deposed by the French Senate. Eventually accepting the inevitable, he was obliged to abdicate in April 1814. Under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he was exiled to the island of Elba, but escaped on 26 February 1815. After landing in France, he rallied the army against King Louis XVIII, but after 100 days, on 18 June 1815 his forces were defeated by the allied armies under the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo.

This caricature is one of several by Rowlandson that closely follows the events after Napoleon’s escape from Elba. It portrays him in Paris, on the balcony of the royal palace of the Tuileries, wearing his uniform but no orders. Standing beside him is his henchman, Marshal Ney, who had risen from lowly origins in Napoleon’s army, turned against him in 1814, and recently re-joined his forces. Both men are embraced by the Devil. Death is perched on the balustrade, holding a dart dripping with blood, and looking into Napoleon’s eyes, tempting him to perpetrate more horror, death, and destruction. However, the sand runs quickly through the hourglass of Time. Below, the crowds hold aloft pikes and bayonets, some skewering human heads. The drawing was published with modifications by Rudolph Ackermann on 16 April 1815. CH"

Brown (1982) 1603","Rowlandson produced many lively images of soldiers and sailors during the period of Napoleonic conflict. Although he was a close friend of the caricaturist James Gillray, his satire generally focused on wry social observation rather than ascerbic political comment.

Spithead is a sheltered body of water at the mouth of the Solent, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, in which the Royal Navy Fleet would anchor. Here two ships await the arrival of rowing boats laden with carousing, buxom women, apparently eager to entertain the crews on board. Sailors were not permitted to go ashore when they returned to port, but ‘wives’ were allowed to visit them, and as the sailors received their pay when the ship docked, prostitutes needed little encouragement. When the Royal George foundered off Spithead in 1782, over 400 prostitutes were found below decks. In 1784 Rowlandson made a brief visit to the Isle of Wight with his friend, the painter Henry Wigstead (1760–1800), possibly to see the wreck of this ship. A less finished version of this drawing is in the Huntington Library, together with nearly 70 watercolours resulting from the trip. They may have been intended for publication with texts by Wigstead, as in the case of Rowlandson’s tours to Brighton (1789) and Wales (1797).2

Never afraid to tackle scenes of rollicking sexuality, Rowlandson produced many semi-pornographic images. However, this scene is in a lighter vein: the woman at the centre of the boat, waving her hat and handkerchief to a man leaning out of a porthole, may well be a genuine spouse, reunited with her husband. Her handkerchief mirrors the billowing skirts of the woman scrambling up the ship’s ladder, while the vast anchor above echoes the curve of her behind. There is a joyful, optimistic quality to the scene, despite the dark context of war and prostitution. The ship’s figurehead is a British lion bearing the cross of St George, to which the woman on the far left appears to raise her glass in a patriotic salute.

Rowlandson’s designs were widely reproduced as prints during his lifetime; within the mount of this drawing is a copy of the hand-coloured etching and aquatint published by Rudolph Ackermann in 1809 as ‘Cattle not Insurable’.3 In 1813 a cruder version was produced by William Elmes, in which barrels of ‘Smugled Coniac Brandy’ and ‘Hollands Gin’ are roped to the stern of the boat.4 Such prints perhaps contributed to the decline in Rowlandson’s reputation, proving too ribald for Victorian tastes. His work went rapidly out of fashion, and did not re-emerge as worthy of serious consideration until after the First World War. CP"

Hyman (1988); Harrison (2012)","It was in the 1830s, while he was staying with his great patron the 13th Earl of Derby at Knowsley Hall, that Lear began to amuse himself and the children of the household by writing nonsense verses illustrated with his own drawings (he never called them limericks). Although most of the nonsense was originally composed for specific children on specific occasions, some of the best were published as A Book of Nonsense in 1846, under the pseudonym Derry Down Derry, taken from a character in the medieval mummers’ plays. Lear finally acknowledged his authorship publicly in the third, much expanded, edition of 1861. This was also the first to enjoy wide currency, the plates being printed from woodblocks rather than lithographic stones. He later published nonsense in other genres, notably Nonsense Songs, Botany and Alphabets (1871), which included for the first time ‘The Owl and the Pussy Cat’.

Several of Lear’s nonsense alphabets survive; six were published in the posthumous edition of Nonsense Botany and Nonsense Alphabets (1889). The present alphabet was made for the infant Ruth Decie. Her parents, Captain Richard Decie and his wife Bella, were stationed in the British garrison on Corfu in the winter of 1861–2, when Lear met them. He already knew Mrs Decie’s parents, William and Arabella Prescott, who lived at Clarence House, Roehampton, christened ‘Hospitality Hall’ by Lear. William Prescott was a partner in the private bank of Prescott, Grote, Cave, and Co., and ‘a hearty, gentlemanly man’, the head of a ‘merry & pleasant family’.1

Lear spent Saturday to Monday, 21 to 23 June 1862 with the Prescotts at Clarence House. He recorded in his diary for Sunday 22 that he ‘rose at 6:30 & made an alphabet for the Decie baby till 9’, and completed it after lunch. The first draught (now in the Houghton Library, Harvard) shows that he must have made the verses for each letter, then copied them out with rough drawings, and finally made the fair copy on blue, linen-backed writing paper after lunch. The subjects, a mixture of animals and domestic articles, would have been familiar to any child. The rabbit is particularly appealing, as he glances sidelong while naughtily munching the flowers. This alphabet, together with illustrated letters, a suite of four ‘Eggstracts from the Roehampton Chronicle’ and other items, became treasured family heirlooms. They passed from the Decies to James Farquharson, who in turn bequeathed them to the Ashmolean."

LI1075.4",,"Throughout his married life, Burne-Jones maintained intense friendships with a succession of women. The last was Helen Mary Gaskell (1853–1940), known as May, whom he met in 1892. She was the wife of a cavalry officer of considerable wealth but little culture, and Burne-Jones soon became dependent on her, declaring that she had ‘reached the well of loneliness that is in me’. He sent her intimate and revealing letters several times a day, and, shortly before his death, recalled ‘six years of the most beautiful friendship that ever there was’. In spite of Burne-Jones’s instructions to burn all their correspondence, Mrs Gaskell carefully preserved their letters. She bequeathed most of them to her surviving daughter, Daphne, because ‘you who knew him will understand that they are so precious and tender and wise and witty, but not for the eye of the scoffer, or for the eye of the casual reader’.

In addition to these private and often deeply emotional letters, Burne- Jones also sent more light-hearted, illustrated letters, which Mrs Gaskell had mounted into two matching albums; a third album, containing only six letters, was given to Lord Balniel (later 28th Earl of Crawford) in 1936.1 Their cast of characters is to some extent familiar from humorous letters written to other correspondents, notably Katie Lewis.2 It includes the artist himself, in a series of cartoon-like tales of mishap and misadventure. Beneath the surface lies the black humour endemic to Burne-Jones’s frequent moods of depression and insecurity; there is, for example, a superb sequence of caricatures of the artist suffering from flu.

One special character who appears frequently in Mrs Gaskell’s letters is a fat lady with ‘abominable’ dress sense, whom Burne-Jones christened Julia Parkington. In this sequence, she is seen making a deep curtsey – ‘as for our deportment in the presence of Royalty, I’ll just trouble you to look’; remarking on a picture, her fan dangerously close to the canvas – ‘we can point out the beauties of pictures with the best of them’; sleeping on a day bed, the drawing so saturated in ink that the artist wondered ‘whether she will dry in time for the afternoon post’; and sleeping in a hammock. Elsewhere, she is captured walking on the cliffs at Rottingdean, near the artist’s country residence, North End House, on a windy day; deliberating over propriety in the bathroom; and sitting in a very tight-fitting bath. The last is annotated by Burne-Jones, ‘I like this best’. CH"

LI1075.5",,"Daphne Gaskell (1887–1964) was the younger daughter of May Gaskell (see cat. 121). Her elder sister, Amy (1874–1910) was a haunting beauty whose portrait Burne-Jones painted in 1893–4.1 Daphne was only six when she met the artist, and he took an affectionate and fatherly interest in her, sending numerous letters written in phonetic spelling, and illustrated with whimsical birds and animals, including such fantastic inventions as the ‘phlumbudge’, the ‘ paddiflab’, the ‘flapdabble’ and the ‘grabblethwacker’. Burne-Jones greatly disliked dogs, and in one rather gruesome letter he complains of being kept awake by a dog barking, so that he was obliged to get dressed and take a ‘choper’ to it. The question he asked Daphne was, inevitably, what should he do with the pieces – ‘I think of sending to have them made up for sossidges for some horsepittle’.

On the other hand, Burne-Jones was very fond of cats. The text of this letter refers to the Gaskell family cat, Thomas.

In later life, Daphne Gaskell married Frank Rose (1874–1914). He was the son of Sir Charles Rose of Hardwick House, Oxfordshire (1874–1913), a politician and keen motorist, who was one of the models for Mr Toad in Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows (1908). Shortly after succeeding as second baronet, Daphne’s husband was killed in action at Ypres. CH"

Hall (1997) pp. 18–9","Beerbohm was an undergraduate at Merton College, Oxford, when he first met Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) in 1890. Their relationship blossomed through a circle of mutual friends, among them Robert Ross and Reginald Turner. The Irish writer was rising to the height of his fame as the author of short stories and criticism. A succession of plays, culminating in The Importance of Being Earnest, which opened on 14 February 1895, consolidated his reputation as the wittiest man in London. Beerbohm’s first publication was an article on ‘Oscar Wilde by an American’ in 1893; it elicited flattering comments from the subject, who called him, ‘incomparably brilliant … he knew no other undergraduate who could have written it’.1 At the same time Beerbohm was publishing his first caricatures, and he contributed both essays and caricatures to such periodicals as The Yellow Book and Sketch. The appearance in 1896 of collections of essays as The Works of Max Beerbohm and of drawings as Caricatures of Twenty-Five Gentlemen confirmed his accomplishments in both areas.

This caricature of Wilde was published in Pick-me-Up magazine on 22 September 1894. Drawn in the thin, nervous, swirling line of Beerbohm’s earliest drawings, it portrays Wilde in a bejewelled shirt front and ring and with an extravagant buttonhole; his features puffy and his hair unfashionably long. In private, Beerbohm was not uncritical of his friend; he wrote to Turner in April 1893 that, ‘I am sorry to say that Oscar drinks far more than he ought … he has deteriorated very much in appearance: his cheeks being quite a dark purple and fat to a fault’.2 Although he always maintained, somewhat disingenuously, that ‘caricature implies no moral judgement on the subject … it eschews any kind of symbolism, tells no story, deals with no matter but the personal appearance of its subject’, Beerbohm came to regret his first and most famous portrayal of Wilde.3 Many years later, he wrote that it ‘showed only the worst side of his nature … I hardly realised what a cruel thing it was: I only realised that after Oscar’s tragedy and downfall’.4 CH"

Hall (1997) pp. 55–6","By 1912, when this caricature was drawn, Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874–1936) had become one of the most recognisable writers in England. The author of apparently innumerable essays, he had also published several novels, ranging from The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904) and The Man who was Thursday (1908) to The Innocence of Father Brown (1911), the first collection of stories featuring the Roman Catholic priest whose insignificant appearance belies extraordinary powers of observation and deduction. Having been slim in his youth, Chesterton had become notoriously obese. Encouraged by his wife, he adopted extravagant dress, habitually wearing a huge cloak and wide-brimmed hat. He frequented the taverns of Fleet Street with his pockets stuffed full of books and papers, somewhat in the guise of a latter-day Dr Johnson.

Even before Chesterton had become famous, Beerbohm went out of his way to meet him. He wrote in 1902 of an

Enormous apparition. Head big for body – way of sinking head on chest. Like a mountain and a volcanic one – constant streams of talk flowing down, paradoxes flung up in the air – very magnificent.1

This caricature exemplifies his view that

The perfect caricature (be it of a handsome man or a hideous or an insipid) must be the exaggeration of the whole creature, from top to toe. Whatsoever is salient must be magnified, whatsoever is subordinate must be proportionately diminished. The whole man must be melted down, as in a crucible, and then, as from the solution, be fashioned anew. He must emerge with not one particle of himself lost, yet with not a particle of himself as it was before. And he will stand there wholly transformed, the joy of his creator, the joy of those who are privy to the art of caricature. … The perfect caricature is not a mere snapshot, it is the epitome of its subject’s surface, the presentment (once and for all) of his most characteristic pose, gesture, expression.2

Chesterton is seen in all his magnificent corpulence at the dinner table, smoking a cigar but apparently before the food and wine have been served. Great folds of flesh are scarcely contained by his suit, while his waistcoat is far from meeting the top of his trousers, revealing his straining braces. In keeping with the subject, the style of the drawing is smooth and round, with wash carefully applied only to the figure. This caricature was published in the Bystander for 24 July 1912. CH"

pl. XII, p. 58; Upstone (2005) p. 39","A product of the Slade School, where he was a close contemporary of Augustus and Gwen John, the Irish painter William Orpen was appointed an official war artist in 1916 and visited the Western Front in April 1917. His early idealism turned to disillusionment as a result of his bitter wartime experiences on the Somme, and the powerful paintings he produced – devastated battlefield landscapes, portraits of fighting men, and haunting victims of shell-shock – convey his horror. An exhibition of his work for the Ministry of Information was held at Agnew’s in spring 1918, simply entitled ‘War’.

Orpen created a number of caricatures of Kaiser Wilhelm, including one of him as the Devil stalking abroad (1914; private collection). Here he uses the Kaiser’s nakedness to emphasise his vulnerability, though the crouching figure, like some grotesquely aged and moustachioed foetus, has a threatening coiled strangeness to it – reminiscent of Japanese Netsuke carvings or the nightmarish figures of Hieronymus Bosch. Orpen felt enormous empathy for those damaged by the war, and his anger is reflected in the savagery of this image. Yet his prints and drawings of German prisoners of war (many in the Imperial War Museum) acknowledge their humanity and show great sympathy for their plight.

A second caricature drawing in the Ashmolean collection, inscribed PEACE / 28th June 1919, was used as a poster for the News of the World (fig. 66). This shows an emaciated, shivering Kaiser sitting cross-legged in the manner of an Indian sadhu, or holy man, on a pile of bones; it may be that the prickly bed of graveyard crosses in the present drawing was also intended to evoke an Indian mystic’s bed of nails. The drawings employ the same paper, medium and style of border, so were undoubtedly produced for the same commission, marking the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

Propaganda was a vital part of the war effort, and many talented artists contributed. The liberal politician Charles Masterman (1873–1927), in charge of the War Propaganda Bureau from August 1914, declared ‘It is absurdly difficult to explain … why any particular piece of propaganda is desirable … Every little piece of it easily looks ridiculous; it is only by the concentrated effect of all that the result we desire is obtained.’1 Far from appearing ridiculous, this drawing still carries a powerful emotive charge that transcends its original political context.

In October 1927 the Canadian-born Lord Beaverbrook, proprietor of the Evening Standard, persuaded Low to join his staff, and Low was to work for him until 1950, despite his cartoons often opposing the Conservative policies that Beaverbrook espoused. Winston Churchill described Low as a ‘green-eyed … Antipodean radical, a master of black and white; he is the Charlie Chaplin of caricature’.1 Although chiefly remembered for his character ‘Colonel Blimp’, Low’s proudest achievement was probably his anti-Appeasement and anti-Nazi cartoons of the 1930s.

This caricature of William Maxwell ‘Max’ Aitken, first Lord Beaverbrook (1879–1964), was published in a supplement to the New Statesman on 27 March 1926. It also appeared as the frontispiece to A. J. P. Taylor’s biography of Beaverbrook (1972), as according to Taylor it was the best likeness of all his portraits. Beaverbrook was a business tycoon, Conservative MP (1910–7) and peer. Appointed Minister of Information in the last months of the First World War, he was responsible for Allied propaganda together with Charles Masterman, and created the British War Memorials Committee. In 1940 Winston Churchill brought him into the War Cabinet, where he held a number of important posts before being appointed Lord Privy Seal (1943–5).

Low produced two series of caricatures of politicians for the New Statesman in 1926 and 1933, of which Lord Beaverbrook considered those of Lloyd George as a ‘lovable cherubic little chap’ to be some of the best.2 Low emphasised the salient points of each subject’s character; in his image of Beaverbrook he reveals his impish propensity to stir up trouble, a hint of malicious puckishness in his over-wide grin and elfin pointed shoes. The dynamic Beaverbrook had a reputation as an unscrupulous master of intrigue, and A. J. P. Taylor described him as ‘a clever restless little boy always up to mischief’.3

Some of Low’s most characteristic work is in ink applied with a brush. Here, however, he demonstrates equal facility in his use of black crayon, although his caricatures are always underpinned by careful drawing in graphite beneath. White bodycolour, or possibly process white, is applied to highlight the telephone mouthpiece, all-important to the newspaper proprietor for barking orders through to his editors and journalists. His fellow cartoonist Ronald Searle has expressed admiration for Low’s sureness of touch, but Ralph Steadman considered him to lack the viciousness of a Gillray. For Steadman, Low was always ‘the insider playing the maverick, hand-in-glove with Lord Beaverbrook’.4 CP"

© The Estate of Ernest Shepard",,"Shepard was conventionally educated at the Royal Academy Schools, but always hoped to work for the satirical magazine Punch. His first drawing was accepted in 1906, but it was not until 1914 that he became a regular contributor. In 1921 he was finally appointed as a member of staff. This position required him to produce at least one humorous drawing for each weekly issue, and assured him of a regular income. It was through his contributions to Punch that he came to the attention of the author A. A. Milne (1882–1956). They collaborated on a volume of children’s verses, published in 1925 as When we were Very Young. This was quickly followed by the first of the immortal volumes featuring a stuffed bear of very little brain, his young owner Christopher Robin, and a group of finely characterised animal friends. Winnie the Pooh appeared in 1926 and was an instant success, with Shepard’s illustrations perfectly complementing Milne’s whimsical stories. As early as 1927 Milne could write that ‘Anybody who has heard of me has certainly heard of Shepard. Indeed our names have been associated on so many title pages that I am beginning to wonder which of us is which’.1

In spite of this fame, Shepard continued to work for Punch, and was promoted second cartoonist in 1935. His subjects were very familiar to the artist and his middle-class readers, and dealt with the domestic difficulties of children, servants, and the rapid changes in society after the First World War. A number of the cartoons portray historical subjects, though Shepard exploited this vein most intensively in the volumes he illustrated for George Bell, Everybody’s Pepys (1926), Everybody’s Boswell (1930), and Everybody’s Lamb (1933). Occasionally, his work was inspired by a current exhibition, for example the cartoon published in Punch on 9 February 1927. Entitled ‘Maniers en Moden: The Effect of the Exhibition of Flemish Pictures’, it illustrated the Royal Academy’s ‘Exhibition of Belgian and Flemish Art 1300–1900’.

The Pre-Raphaelite Cocktail Party was reproduced in Punch on 28 February 1934. As the inscription makes clear, it was prompted by a visit to the exhibition celebrating the centenary of the birth of William Morris at the Victoria and Albert Museum, an event opened by the former Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on 9 February 1934. The idea may owe something to Beerbohm’s cartoons of Rossetti and his Circle (1922). Among the figures incongruously participating in this thoroughly modern form of entertainment are Morris and his wife, Jane Burden, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his wife, Elizabeth Siddal. As Shepard wrote on a preparatory study for this drawing, ‘I am now come to the conclusion perhaps as well that cocktail parties were not the thing in artistic circles 40 years ago’.2 CH"

(2000) no. 46","In 1994 the Ashmolean Museum received 64 sketchbooks by Ardizzone, an extraordinary wealth of material by this gifted draughtsman. These date from 1940 to 1979 and contain thousands of lively sketches in graphite, pen and ink, and watercolour depicting beach scenes, public house and law court interiors, together with figure studies and portraits. They also include preparatory ideas for some of Ardizzone’s book illustrations. The good humour of his work and the ease of his penmanship are both reminiscent of Rowlandson.

Occasionally, Ardizzone kept a form of visual diary, as during his wartime stay in Southsea or his visit to the west of Ireland in 1958.1 This sketchbook of 1950 is an especially whimsical record of a short trip to Dieppe with his brother David and the artist Barnett Freedman, a teacher at the Royal College of Art and Ruskin School in Oxford. The visit seems to have entailed much bibulous over-indulgence; even before the trio leave the cross-Channel ferry they ‘Drink much whisky in the bar so arrive rather elated’ (fol. 25). There follows a detailed list of gastronomic delights, such as a ‘mountain’ of mussels, lobster mayonnaise, duck terrine trufflé, and roast pigeon with garlic toast – in addition to the landlady’s fine kidneys (rognons). Here we see folios 28 verso and 29, towards the end of their stay. The diary closes with all three walking by the sea under the cliffs of Dieppe, silhouetted against a spectacular sunset.

The contrast with Ardizzone’s earlier visit to the Normandy coastline could not be more telling. Appointed an official war artist in February 1940, he worked with the British Expeditionary Force, travelling through North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. Joining the Allied forces on 12 June 1944, he landed at Sword Beach near Caen, to the west of Dieppe. Ardizzone spent his first night lying ‘cold as the grave’ in a collapsing foxhole under bombardment, before hitch-hiking inland as far as Bayeux and back.2 As a fellow war artist, Freedman had also been in northern France just after D-Day (6 June 1944) to record scenes around the landing beaches and at the invasion headquarters. Just six years later they are watching fireworks rather than shells exploding on the French coast, and being warned of the grave dangers to health of taking snuff. CP"

(2000) no. 17; Taylor (2000) pp. 81–92","Best known for illustrating books for children, Edward Ardizzone is in fact far broader in the range of his draughtsmanship. The Ashmolean collection has, for instance, three war-related watercolours and a series of pen and ink studies for the Gospels.1 Ardizzone’s formal training – consisting of evening classes at Westminster School of Art under Bernard Meninsky (1891–1950) – was minimal, and the distinctive personal style he evolved through constant repetition and practice altered little through his lifetime. As his daughter Christianna describes, Ardizzone was a compulsive doodler and sketcher, though he preferred (like Cruikshank and Daumier) to create his illustrations not from life, but from his head, storing up a visual dictionary of pictorial ideas and ‘symbols for forms’.2

This drawing was created as a gift for Ardizzone’s American publisher Geoffrey ‘Jock’ Cumberlege, to whom he owed publication of his first ‘Little Tim’ story by Oxford University Press in 1936. It shows the prolific illustrator welcoming some of his best-known characters into his first-floor studio at 130 Elgin Avenue, much to the alarm of his cat. Peering over the edge of the drawing board in typically cheeky fashion is Tim’s friend Ginger. Tim and Lucy take centre stage, with Lucy’s kindly guardian Mr Grimes, his housekeeper Mrs Smawley, and Charlotte to their right. Captain McFee, Joey Adze, the ship’s carpenter, and the second mate are entering far right. The gaze exchanged between Tim and ‘Uncle Ted’ is one of great affection.

Ardizzone sits on a raised dais normally used for posing an artist’s model, in front of his tilted drawing board – just as in a profile self-portrait that immediately follows the ‘Visit to Dieppe’ in Sketchbook 12 (cat. 128).3 Demonstrating Ardizzone’s typical technique, the flowing calligraphic lines in black ink are confidently improvised with a nibbed pen over loosely applied, soft watercolour washes, covering a faint tonal underdrawing in hard graphite. This drawing balances line and colour in a way that Ardizzone complained was difficult to achieve in reproduction, as colour printing techniques entailed creating a separate black line drawing on a transparent overlay. He emphasised the value of original works that united the two elements, permitting a last-minute accenting and balancing of the composition, or ‘working over’, which added depth to the image. Only this, he felt, was a proper record of the illustrator’s skill.4 CP"

The former began life while the artist was imprisoned in the notorious Changi jail, where he drew the first cartoons of the series which were published monthly from November 1945 in the periodical Lilliput. He eventually tired of the schoolgirls’ anarchic activities, and killed them off in his book, Souls in Torment (1952). However, by then others had assumed responsibility for their future, and the girls’ fame spread much wider with the first of the films by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliatt, The Belles of St Trinian’s, released in 1954.

St Custard’s, on the other hand, was created by the author Geoffrey Willans (1911–1958), based on his own experiences as a schoolboy and schoolmaster before the Second World War. Searle made his first illustrations to Willans’s stories in the magazine The Young Elizabethan, and the two collaborated closely on four books: Down with Skool!, published in 1953, followed by How to be Topp (1954), Whizz for Attoms (1956), and Back in the Jug Agane (1959). All four books relate the tribulations of ‘nigel molesworth the curse of st custard’s’, a senior boy at a preparatory school, whose spelling is phonetic and erratic, whose cynicism is unbounded, and who maintains that

the only good things about skool are the BOYS wizz who are noble brave fearless etc. although you hav various swots, cissies, milksops, greedy guts and oils with whom I am forced to migle hem-hem.

How to be Topp is subtitled ‘a guide to Sukcess for tiny pupils, including all there is to kno about space’, and explains how to succeed in most aspects of school life – academic, sporting, and social. The final chapters give advice on ‘how to cope with grown ups’, especially at Christmas. The dust jacket of the first edition shows Molesworth looking extremely self-satisfied and wearing a mortar board. For the reissue published by Pavilion Books in 1992, Searle adapted an earlier cover used by Puffin Books. ‘Sir Molesworth’ is now shown triumphing over the dragon of his enemies, shield and sword aloft in an unmistakably balletic pose which might have been censured by his younger self in the 1950s.

© Gerald Scarfe",,"Scarfe has worked for Punch and Private Eye, but is best known as the political cartoonist for The Sunday Times, with which he has been associated since 1967. This drawing was reproduced on 29 June 1975, and refers to the Conservative Party’s victory in the by-election in Woolwich West. Following the death of the sitting Labour Member of Parliament, the Conservative candidate was again Peter Bottomley (b. 1944). He had been beaten in the general election in the previous year. He succeeded in overturning the Labour majority of 3,541, winning by 2,382 votes. This represented a considerable swing away from the beleaguered government of Harold Wilson, though it was not for another four years that the Labour-Liberal alliance was ousted at the general election on 3 May 1979.

The two figures congratulating each other are Edward Heath (1916–2005) and Margaret Thatcher (1925–2013). Heath had served as Prime Minister from June 1970 until the Conservative Party was narrowly beaten by Labour in the general election of March 1974. He remained as leader of the party until he was succeeded by Mrs Thatcher on 11 February 1975. The Woolwich West by-election thus represented her first significant success as party leader. In emulation of Sir Winston Churchill’s frequent signal of ‘v’ for victory during the Second World War, Heath and Mrs Thatcher are seen making ‘v’ signs to each other, not palm outwards, as Churchill had done, but palm inwards, in an insulting gesture more typically associated with juvenile rudeness. Scarfe’s caricatures are freely and confidently drawn, with very regular hatching to define forms and volume.

Mrs Thatcher went on to become the longest-serving British Prime Minister of the twentieth century (1979–90), while Heath became Father of the House of Commons in 1992, retiring from politics in 2001, and remaining bitter about his rival’s success all his life. The two were frequent subjects for Scarfe, who chronicled Mrs Thatcher’s rise from Education Secretary in 1971, when she was responsible for withdrawing the daily allowance of free milk for schoolchildren and became known as the ‘Milk Snatcher’, to her defeat as leader of the Conservative Party in 1990.

2015","Literature: Phillips (2005) nos. 51, 85,
87 and 96","In his essay ‘Pleasures of Boredom: Four Centuries of Doodles’, the art historian E. H. Gombrich traced the practice of doodling as far back as the Middle Ages. He argued that not only did contemporary art influence the style of the doodles, but also that, in the case of a true artist, the doodles themselves, to some extent unconscious, affected more deliberate acts of creativity.1 In general, doodles are based either on images, or on words, and often a combination of the two. This explains their appeal to Tom Phillips – an artist who has always combined text and images in imaginative new ways (cat. 114).

Most artists have a compulsive need to set pen or pencil to paper as a means of exploring the subconscious or experimenting stylistically, but when does a doodle become ‘art’? Going one step further than Paul Klee’s famous notion of ‘taking a line for a walk’, Phillips turns actual doodling into an art form in his Merry Meetings, published in 2005. (The ironic title is taken from the opening lines of Shakespeare’s Richard III: ‘Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths, … / Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings.’) A total of 107 images sketched at board meetings of the British Museum, Royal Academy, National Portrait Gallery and elsewhere, the doodles playfully undermine the stuffy formalities of these august institutions, represented by their printed agendas and business plans.

Shown here are just four sheets that demonstrate the variety of Phillips’s doodling techniques, ranging from simple patterning, mazes and amorphous shapes to portraits of fellow board members. These were not originally intended for display, though the use of colour seems to imply – far more than would a simple black penline – a conscious aestheticising intrusion into the process. The imaginative incorporation of one image into another and the use of line are strongly reminiscent of Picasso’s drawing technique, as recorded in 1956 by Henri-Georges Clouzot in his film, Le Mystère Picasso.

These works represent a subversive exploration of the gap between boredom and concentration, questioning what is allowable in such official contexts. Phillips insists that, far from distracting him, his drawing acts as an aid to concentration; it occupies the visual part of his brain while freeing his mind to focus on what is being said. ‘The inner narcolept,’ as he puts it, ‘can be triumphed over by any of the techniques of shading, especially the rhythmic bliss of cross-hatching.’2 CP"
