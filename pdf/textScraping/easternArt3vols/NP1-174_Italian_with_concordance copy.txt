Museum Catalogue No. NP1 and 2. 
Flagellators of Christ
23.2 cms. (height of No. 1, figure with both arms raised); 
23.5 cms. (height of No. 2, figure with right arm only raised); 
5.5 cms. (height of plinths)
Location of object: Weldon Gallery 
Material: Bronze with a warm brown natural patina retaining extensive patches 
of translucent red varnish, now partially blackened, especially in the 
hollows. 
Techniques:
Hollow, lostwax, casts. 
Object Description: There is a perforation in the bronze 
below the loin cloth worn by No. 1, also a plug beside the ankle 
of the right foot of this figure. Both figures are very finely tooled 
with the hair (including hair in armpits and pubes) sharply but 
boldly cut. The loin cloth is minutely punched. The figures must 
originally have held separately fashioned whips.
Both figures are mounted on plinths of oak veneered with brass, 
firegilt, and with tortoiseshell, fitted with bronze scrollfeet and 
lion masks, also firegilt. 
Condition: (Some pieces of veneer are loose, broken, 
or missing especially below the lion heads on the back and side faces 
of both plinths.) 
Signature or mark: There are circular paper labels below the plinths 
with black borders and `J. FRANCIS. &. MARGARET. MALLETT' 
printed, and with `27E' inscribed in ink, in the centre. Both plinths marked `M ~u176~u1~u' and `M ~u176~u2~u' in black paint on the corner 
of the upper ormolu moulding of the plinth where chamfered.
Provenance [WHo]  J. F. Mallett, who died 7 January 1947. 
Provenance (How) Bequest
Provenance (When )Received in the Museum during the last week in May 1947. 
Earlier history: No. 176 (1 and 2) in the inventory of his collection where valued at Â£100. No provenance supplied.
Described by Mallett as `Finely modelled and highly finished. 
Beautiful brown patina. N. Italian. Attributed to Pietro 
Tacca.' 
Associated names: The pair of figures are in fact cast from models almost 
certainly made by Algardi. Together with a figure of Christ 
bound to the column, they formed one of the most popular 
small sculptural groups (of silver as well as of bronze) in 
European art. 
Associated objects:The same model for Christ is employed with 
flagellators of a different design which may plausibly be 
attributed to Duquesnoy, who is indeed credited by Bellori 
with the invention of a group of this subject (including 
Christ). 
Discussions: Jennifer Montagu has proposed, convincingly, that 
the more vigorous of the pairs of flagellators_that 
represented by the Ashmolean's bronzes_originated in 
models by Algardi. She dates these models to the second half 

of the 1630s. Of this particular pair of bronzes she writes: 
`The casts appear to be reasonably old, although the Boulle
type bases are no doubt of more recent date' (J. Montagu, 
Alessandro Algardi (London and New Haven, Conn., 1985), 
i. 197, ii. 315-22, no. 9; and for the Ashmolean bronzes 319, 
no. 9 C. 19). The bases resemble in both style and materials 
French work of the late seventeenth century of the kind 
revived in the second half of the eighteenth century, but they 
may be of modern manufacture; certainly all screw fittings 
appear to be modern. The figures, which are of as high quality 
as any other bronze versions I have seen, seem to be either
Italian or French. See also No. 434.


1899 F 37 NP 3
Luigi AMICI (1813-97)
3. Thalia
53.5 cms. (height excluding socle); 13 cms. (height of socle)
Carrara marble. 
The turned and waisted socle (made of a different 
piece of marble) has been broken at the base, repaired, and then 
rebroken. Some chips are missing.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S. 37 in his catalogues. 
Said in the large catalogue and the notebook catalogue to have been 
acquired from Amici in Rome in 1853; but in the preliminary 
catalogue of 1857 the date is given as 1851.
This bust of the Muse of Comedy was evidently acquired with 
that of Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy (No. 20), as a 
companion, this couple in turn forming a pair for the two 
copies of antique heads by Gott (Nos. 514, 515). Fortnum 
noted that it was `Thalia. Copy from the antique statue in the 
Vatican'. The statue in question is a seated Muse in the Sala 
delle Muse in the Museo PioClementino which was 
discovered, together with the Melpomene and other Muses, 
at the supposed Villa di Cassio at Tivoli in excavations 
commenced before 1773 by Domenico de' Angelis, and was 
obtained for the papal museum by the intervention of 
GiovanniBattista Visconti in 1774 (W. Amelung and
G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums, III,
i (Berlin, 1935-56), no. 503_erroneously 508 in plates;
C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichita~6 sotto il pontificato 
di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 139-40). The copy is in some 
respects an improvement on the original, in which the leaves 
in the hair are not completely undercut but retain their 
bridges. Amici had worked in Canova's studio and was one 
of the leading sculptors in Rome in the decades following 
Canova's death. He completed the tomb of Pope Gregory 
XVI in St Peter's in 1854 and would have been busy with 
this huge work when Fortnum visited his studio. Such a bust 
is likely to have been produced under Amici's supervision 
rather than executed by him in person and was probably a 
stock item designed for sale to studio visitors rather than 
specially commissioned. An identical bust is in the Royal 
Palace in Madrid (numbered 427 in hollow behind chest), 

also paired with a Melpomene. Another was lot 246 in the sale 
of Durwards Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, Christie's, 10-11 July 
1989.

1888 F B1088 NP 4
Style of Bartolommeo AMMANATI 
1511-92
Inkstand in the form of a faun 
astride a tortoise
22.5 cms. (height); 19.75 cms. (length)
Bronze with a dark brown natural patina with traces of black or 
blackened varnish in the hollows. Thickwalled hollow cast. Cast in 
two pieces; the faun and shell together with the shell of the tortois forming one piece. There is a plug in the faun's right shoulder and a firing crack in the back of the faun's neck and in the top of his left arm. There seems to have been an extra pouring of metal in the 
head. Chaplet pins evident in the interior of the bronze (at faun's 
right shoulder). `B/_88/' is painted in white on the interior of 
the tortoise shell together with a recent label numbered `112'. The 
same is painted on the inside of the body of the tortoise with 
another label numbered `112' below.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the 
same year. B. 1088 in his catalogues. Presumably acquired after 
1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not included, 
was compiled.
An ink pot would presumably have been placed in the shell 
held in the faun's right hand. Divisions for pen and sand are 
found in the body of the tortoise. Classed by Fortnum as 
`Florentine?' and dated to 1580 in his notebook catalogue. 
Having discovered that it was in the manner of Bartolommeo 
Ammanati (1511-92), he corrected the date to 1560, and 
toyed with the idea that it might be by Ammanati, but, surely 
rightly, confined himself to observing that there is an obvious 
debt to the latter's eight splitlegged fauns, some with similar 
grins and brushedback hair, placed in 1575 around the rim 
of the Fountain of Neptune in the Piazza della Signoria in 
Florence_works designed probably in 1560 when Ammanati 
was competing for the commission. Bode, oddly, seems to 
have ignored this connection and published the inkstand as 
a Venetian work of around 1575 (Italian Bronze Statuettes of 
the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), i. 74, fig. 90). Pope
Hennessy on the other hand regarded it as `likely that the 
inkstand is an autograph small bronze by Ammanati' (Italian 
Bronze Statuettes (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 
1961), no. 113). J. Draper in his 1980 revised edition of Bode 
has suggested `North Italian late Sixteenth Century'.
The surface of the bronze is very dull and the linear pattern 
of the tortoise shell and skin in particular is blunt and vague. 
This is also true of the version in the Metropolitan Museum, 
New York (10.173_in reserve), but less true of that in the 
Rijksmuseum (J. Leeuwenberg, Beeldhouwkunst in het 
Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, 1973), 379, no. 638). (Neither 
of these versions retains the body of the tortoise as a base.) 
It is surely very unlikely that any of these three bronzes are 
autograph works by Ammanati. The casting technique (which 

may not be lostwax) does not resemble that of any sixteenth
century bronze inkstand I have inspected. It is possible that 
they were made in the last century when at least one sculptor 
was an accomplished mimic of Ammanati's style_this was 
Francesco Pozzi (1779-1844), who, in 1831, executed the 
righthand satyr of the southeast face of the fountain_the 
`satyr to left of the marine goddess who looks towards the 
Marzocco' (A. Lensi, Il Palazzo Vecchio (Milan, 1929), 315, 
citing F. Moise~6, Illustrazione storicoartistica del Palazzo de' 
Priori, oggi Palazzo Vecchio (Florence, 1843), 169 n.)_as a 
replacement for one of Ammanati's. This large bronze is, 
however, a superior cast, the equal of its neighbours and far 
sharper than the inkstands. For a reduction of a part of 
Ammanati's fountain on a scale comparable with the inkstands 
see Christie's, New York, 1 November 1989, lot 53.


Foundry of de ANGELIS fils (early twentieth century)
5. Victory
39.3 cms. (height from foot to head); 12.2 cms. (length of shaft); 
9 cms. (diameter of marble ball)
Bronze with a dull green patina and simulated corroded surface. 
Hollow cast, filled with core. A red paste gem is inserted in the 
bracelet on the figure's left upper arm. Cast without right arm of 
index finger of the figure's left hand and with empty eye sockets 
(replicating damaged original). The shaft stamped with miniature 
letters: `DEANGELISFILS'. Mounted on a ball of Porto venere marble 
(black marble with gold veins) and a columnar shaft of ebonized 
wood (the latter not original).
Bequeathed by the Rev. J. W. R. Brocklebank in 1926. No. 30 on 
Andrew Shirley's receipt of January 1927 (`A verde statuette, 
Victory, standing on marble sphere & plinth').
This is unusual among the bronzes in Brocklebank's collection 
in that it is a replica of an antique, but it is nevertheless not 
unrelated in taste to his other pieces, and in particular his 
versions of Gilbert's treatment of the same theme (Nos. 502, 
503, 512). The firm of De Angelis was founded in 1840 and 
prospered in the last years of the last century and in the early 
years of this, specializing in reproductions of the most popular 
items in the Naples Museum. Larger works produced by 
them in the first decade of this century are signed `S. de 
Angelis & Fils' (see the lifesize Athlete at Cartwright Hall, 
Bradford, dated 1905 and the reduction of the Adorante sold 
at Sotheby's, London, 11 June 1987, lot 239/2, dated 1907). 
By 1915 the firm had merged with that of Chiurazzi (which 
had been established in 1870 by J. Chiurazzi) to form the 
`Fonderie Artistiche Riunite'. By 1929 the firm was under the 
management of Frederico and Salvatore Chiurazzi and known 
as `Chiurazzi', or, officially, the `Societa~6 Anonima: Fonderie, 
Ceramica, Marmoria'. Their catalogue of that year noted that 
the firm was formerly that of `Chiurazzi and De Angelis'. In 
this catalogue the `Vittoria' appears as no. 93, and was 
available in four sizes of which one was the size of the original 
(40 cms._as here, approximately; two of the others were 

larger) and in three patinas (Pompeian, Herculanean, and 
Renaissance, the first, which is used here, being closest to the 
original and also the cheapest, at 1,000 lire for this size, as 
against 1,250 for the black Herculanean and 1,500 for the 
brown Renaissance). The Roman bronze reproduced has the 
inventory number 4997 in the Naples Museum, and the 
modern number 576. It is regarded as a copy of a Hellenistic 
original and is not now included in the popular anthologies, 
although Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue describes it as `questa 
mirabile statua . . . rimarchevole per la leggerezza del drappo 
svolazzante al vento e che delinea le svelte forme del corpo'. 
As Chiurazzi acknowledged, the marble ball is a modern idea 
(found in the display of the bronze in the Naples Museum). 
The figure would originally have been suspended from the 
ring in its back. The bronze in the Naples Museum is also 
furnished with a wand in the figure's left hand but the figure 
would originally have held a palm or trophy. The other arm 
would, it is supposed, have held a trumpet to broadcast 
victory. A version of the Victory in the Glasgow Art gallery 
and Museum (9328d) was purchased from Sabatino de 
Angelis et fils on 30 March 1893 for Â£8. An inferior cast was 
lot 148, Sotheby's, London 4 July 1991.


Probably foundry of de ANGELIS/CHIURAZZI (early 
twentieth century)
6. Heroic head (socalled 
Dionysosplaton)
47.3 cms. (height of bronze); 22 cms. (height of socle); 26 cms. 
(diameter of socle)
Bronze of a dull black to dark green patina simulating corrosion. 
Hollow, lostwax, cast. The upper portion of the back dented. The 
iron cramp attaching the bronze to the socle loose.
Provenance unknown.
The simulated diaspro di Sicilia marble employed for the 
socle is of a type often employed by the firm of De 
Angelis/Chiurazzi (for which see No. 5). The bronze is an 
accurate replica of a fragment of a statue found in the 
eighteenth century in the Villa dei Pisoni, Herculaneum 
(Museo Nazionale, Naples, inv. no. 5618, modern number 
605). It was long supposed, following a theory of Sogliani, 
to represent an ideal mingling of the type of Dionysus with 
the likeness of Plato and was known as the Dionysosplaton. 
Friederichs considered it an original by Scopas or Praxiteles, 
but it is now regarded as a hellenistic modification (or 
sometimes as a Roman copy of a Hellenistic modification) of 
an earlier model. (A. and B. Maiuri, Das Nationalmuseum in 
Neapel (Munich, 1958), 66.) In Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue 
this is no. 1 and priced at 2,400 lire for the original size (given 
as 50 cms. but the same as this version) in the `Herculanean' 
patina (black). It cost 3,000 lire with a `Renaissance' patina 
(brown), and was not available with a `Pompeian' patina 
(green). It could also be purchased 28 and 15 cms high. The 
turned and waisted socle, unhappy in size and shape, 

reproduces that upon which the bronze in the Naples Museum 
is mounted. Other versions of this bronze are furnished with 
an alabaster base (one was with the dealer Edric Van 
Vredenburgh, Davies Street, London, in the winter of 1989). 
One in the Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow (9328b) was 
purchased from Sabatino de Angelis et fils on 30 March 1893 
for Â£12.


Perhaps foundry of de ANGELIS/CHIURAZZI (early 
twentieth century)
7. Adorante
130.5 cms. (height, including integral plinth, to top of head); 
6.5 cms. (height of integral plinth); 31.8 cms (length and width 
of plinth)
Metal with a black patina, scratched and worn in small areas of the 
chest and thigh. Neither the rusty colour of the metal where it is 
apparent beneath the patina nor the sound of it when struck suggest 
that it is of bronze as usually defined. Hollow cast. The plinth has 

been cast separately, but the feet are very tightly attached. There i 
s 
a small hole for fixing a leaf above the penis.
Provenance unrecorded. It had been for many years in the basement 
store of the Department of Western Art when it was, in November 
1985, erected in the principal niche of the main staircase of the 
Museum. The sculpture is unlikely ever to have been acquired by 
the Department of Western Art and had probably strayed into its 
store from the Department of Antiquities.
Bronze casts of this famous antique statue were offered for 
sale in the early decades of this century by the firm of De 
Angelis and Chiurazzi (for which see No. 5). In the catalogue 
of 1929 produced by the firm (by then trading as the Societa~6 
Anonima: Fonderie, Ceramica, Marmoria) it is the `Fanciullo 
Orante', no. 734 and offered in four sizes: 127 cms. (the size 
of the original, as here), 71 cms., 36 cms., and 27 cms. In the 
original size and with a black or `Herculanean' patina, as 
here, it cost 5,000 lire, and with a chocolate brown or 
`Renaissance' patina, 6,000 lire. A smaller version of the 
Adorante marked as made by `S. de Angelis et fils' and dated 
1907 was lot 239(2), Sotheby's, London, 11 June 1987. The 
Ashmolean's cast is certainly similar in character to bronzes 
of this size produced by the Neapolitan foundries, but it is 
unmarked and it is impossible to be sure that it was not 
produced at an earlier date elsewhere. The `gÃ©nie adorant' 
was cast in bronze by Barbedienne's Paris foundry, for example 
(one is mentioned by A. de Champeaux, Dictionnaire des 
fondeurs, ciseleurs, modeleurs en bronze (Paris, 1886), 67), and 
there is a fine cast datable to 1826 and chiselled on its plinth 
as `Gegossen von Krebs, Ciseliert v. CouÃ©' in Berlin-Dahlem 
(Ex aere solido: Bronzen von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. 
Eine Ausstellung der Stiftung preu~^Wischer Kulturbesitz Berlin 
aus den Besta~8nden ihrer Staatlichen Museen (Berlin 1983), 
201-3, entry by Peter Bloch).

The fame of the Adorante was such that it should perhaps 
have been included in the anthology of the most celebrated 
antique statues compiled by F. Haskell and N. Penny (Taste 
and the Antique (London and New Haven, Conn., 1981) ). 
The statue seems first to be mentioned by Lorenzo da Pavia 
writing to Isabella d'Este on 28 September 1503. A Greek 
bronze statue of a boy had arrived in Venice with arms and 
one foot broken off. It belonged to a Knight of Rhodes, 
Andrea di Martini, by whom it seems to have been bequeathed 
to Benedetto di Martini. A private view was arranged for 
Isabella. Enea Vico tells a story of how Pietro Bembo donated 
a spare antique bronze foot from his collection to the owner 
in order to complete the figure. There is a very curious letter 
from Aretino to Benedetto of January 1549 in which the statue 
is described as a Ganymede and ascribed to Phidias and the 
lower parts preferred to the upper and the back preferred to 
the front. Aretino also alludes to a story later reported by 
Francesco Sansovino in more detail (Delle cose notabili che sono 
in Venetia . . . (Venice, 1561), 19r) that Cardinal Nicolo 
Ridolfi (1501-50) offered a benefice worth 300 scudi per 
annum for the statue. A copy of the statue (now in the Museo 
Archeologico in Venice) was donated to the Venetian state 
in 1576. This was perhaps the date at which it left Venice. By 
1589 it was certainly in the Bevilacqua Collection in Verona. 
Thence it passed to the Gonzaga in Mantua, and so on to 
King Charles I of England, to Fouquet at VauxleVisconte 
in 1661, to Prince Euge~6ne of Savoy in 1717, to Prince Wenzel 
of Lichtenstein, and to Frederick the Great in 1747. In 1787 
it was placed in the Stadtschloss in Berlin whence it was 
removed by Napoleon to the Louvre (where it was to be seen 
1808-12). It was still often referred to as a Ganymede in this 
period. From Paris it was returned to Berlin and the Staatliche 
Museen. (M. Perry, `A Greek Bronze in Renaissance Venice',

Baccio BANDINELLI (1493-1560)
8. Head of St Paul
39.7 cms. (height); 13.7 cms. (height of socle at front); 18.3 cms. 
(diameter of socle)
Pinkgrey terracotta with traces of white plaster especially in cracks and hollows. Hollow but with very thick walls. Apertures are concealed behind the beard to proper left. There are hairline cracks in many places. A chip is missing on the collar to proper right. A portion of the moustache and proper right eyebrow is made up with 
wax slightly darker than the terracotta. Finger prints are evident in 
some areas (e.g. in the beard and earlobe to proper left). Mounted, 
by means of lead reinforced with, and largely concealed by, plaster 
of Paris, to a turned and waisted socle of verde di Prato (Tuscan 
serpentine). `S. 24.' is painted in black on the back of the collar.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888, given later in the 

same year. S. 24 in his catalogues. Bought by Fortnum from the 
sculptor and dealer Professor Emilio Santarelli of Florence in 1870 
together with a bust of Lorenzo de' Medici. The socle is shown in 
Fortnum's photographs and must have been fixed in Florence. A 
letter from Santarelli to Fortnum of 19 June 1870 discusses shipping 
from Livorno (undertaken through the agency of Luigi Stombert). 
The head had safely arrived on 26 July, followed by Santarelli's 
certificate, dated 16 August, in which he declared that he had 
acquired it `circa venti anni fa'_i.e. in about 1850_from 
Professore Bibliotecario Ajazzi who had, he understood, long owned 
it. It was `formerly in the Laurentian Library whence it had been 
abstracted many years ago'. In his notebook catalogue Fortnum 
recorded that Santarelli would not for a long while agree to part 
with this head and the bust of Lorenzo. He paid Â£40 for the latter: 
this is likely to have cost the same amount.
Emilio Santarelli, who sold this terracotta to Fortnum, had 
acquired it from Ajazzi as a portrait of Cellini. Santarelli also 
believed it to be by Cellini. Santarelli was one of the leading 
sculptors in Florence and also a noted connoisseur (for other 
dealings betwen him and Fortnum see the Preliminary Essay). 
His most famous work was the fulllength portrait of 
Michelangelo completed in 1856 for the Arcade of the Uffizi 
and he was much concerned with the iconography of famous 
Florentines of the Renaissance and incurably optimistic about 
the portraits of them. Fortnum was at least convinced that it 
was by Cellini, although the possibility of it being by Bandinelli 
had occurred to him. It is `beyond Baccio Bandinelli, & the 
rest, and by M. angelo it certainly is not', he wrote in the 
notebook catalogue. The attribution is defended at greater 
length in his large catalogue: `the vigorous expression, the 
quiver of the lip, and the admirable treatment of the beard 
are remarkable. I do not know any other sculptor of the 
period of its unquestionable production with whose manner 
it so much agrees. It seems to me too good for B. Bandinelli.' 
The handling he compared with that in Cellini's bust portrait 
of Bindo Altoviti (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston) 
and the statue of Perseus in the Loggia dei Lanzi_both of 
them bronzes, and indeed no comparable work in clay by 
Cellini_or by Bandinelli_seems to have survived. Fortnum 
noted that Cellini was said to have modelled a bust of Annibale 
Caro `to the medals of whom this bears some resemblance'. 
C. F. Bell, however, annotating the large catalogue, noted 
that this possibility was ruled out by comparison with Dosio's 
memorial bust of Caro in S. Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. 
Bell also `inclined' to think that it was by Bandinelli, to whom 
it seems first to have been attributed by E. Plon (Benvenuto 
Cellini, orfe~6vre, mÃ©dailleur, sculpteur (Paris, 1883), 341). 
The modern literature on Cellini, most recently the 
monograph by PopeHennessy of 1986, does not discuss the 
terracotta. Maria Grazia Ciardi DuprÃ© in 1963 published the 
head as by Rustici (`Giovan Francesco Rustici', Paragone, 14 
(1963), 45-6), but without giving compelling reasons. 
Charles Avery in a letter to Ian Lowe of 9 March 1967 
speculated that there might be a connection with a marble 

bust of Andrea Doria recently acquired by the Victoria and 
Albert Museum and attributed to Montorsoli.
One can see why Fortnum preferred to give this head to 
Cellini rather than to Bandinelli: he was right to liken it to 
the bust of Bindo Altoviti (the vigorous treatment of the beard 
is especially close) and it has the fire of Cellini's bronze 
portrait of Cosimo and none of the blandness of Bandinelli's 
marble portrait of the same sitter. On the other hand, the 
head certainly resembles those in the engraved portraits of 
Bandinelli and in his own selfportraits (most notably as 
Nicodemus in the Pieta~6 which marks his own tomb in SS 
Annunziata in Florence, in the profile relief in the Museo 
dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence, and in the painting in the 
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston). There is a still 
closer relationship with some drawings by Bandinelli of amply 
bearded, frowning men, usually regarded as somewhat 
idealized selfportraits, and perhaps intended as such, of which 
one notable example is in the British Museum (1895915
555), and another was recently with La Sire~6ne, of 14 rue de 
L'EschaudÃ©, Paris (no. 41 in their catalogue of Estampes et 
dessins anciens (1987) I). But both of these have rounded and 
softer modelling, typical of Bandinelli's drawings in chalk 
(and his marble reliefs), which is particularly evident in the 
hair, which flows forward in ornamental curls, whereas in the 
terracotta it is roughly clawed back and stabbed.
This need not discourage us from an attribution to 
Bandinelli, however, for whom working in clay may well have 
been analogous to drawing with a quill or reed, in which 
medium his work has a similar jagged energy. Furthermore, 
there is one marble sculpture by Bandinelli which is so similar 
to this terracotta that the two works must be closely related: 
the head of the saint in the niche to the left of Pope Leo X 
in the latter's tomb of 1536-41 in S. Maria sopra Minerva, 
Rome_a saint intended for St Paul but consistently 
misidentified (see R. Ward, Baccio Bandinelli (Fitzwilliam 
Museum, Cambridge, May-July 1988), 58-9). If the 
terracotta is what it seems_a large preparatory sketch for the 
marble (or even the fragment of a clay sketch for the marble 
salvaged and baked) then it is a very rare survival, without 
parallel in the sculpture of its period. The heads are difficult 
to compare (the marble can only be studied from below) but 
the differences are slight. In the marble the hair on the crown 
is more pronounced, the beard neater, the lips more pouted.
A sample was taken from the terracotta by Mrs Doreen 
Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for 
Archaeology and the History of Art in March 1987 and 
thermoluminescence tests suggested a firing date between

After Baccio BANDINELLI (1493-1560)
9. Cleopatra

29.6 cms. (height of figure, excluding integrally cast tang); 
3.4 cms. (height of base)
Bronze with a greenybrown natural patina and traces of a red
brown varnish, blackened in parts. Hollow, lostwax, cast. There is 
a crack at the back of the figure's right heel. Large holes (0.3 cms. 

diameter) in the proper left buttock and on the back of the proper 
right thigh and right shoulder, more or less imperfectly filled, 
evidently derive from chaplet pins which have shaken loose. 
Mounted on a triangular base with three feet with a large threaded 
hole into which the tang fits (for the base see below).
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the 
same year. B. 412 in his catalogues. `bt. Florence 1865.'
Fortnum regarded this as `somewhat coarsely executed but 
with a distinctive character': the inept chiselling between the 
legs, the uncleaned junction of forearm and head, the hideous 
nipples, the botched modelling of the eyes (one smudged 
and the other crudely stabbed to suggest a pupil) deserve less 
qualified censure. He considered it as `probably intended for 
Eve, the serpent fondling rather than wounding'. Cleopatra 
seems more likely, for although it is odd for that heroine to 
be represented completely undressed, the reptile is more the 
size of an asp than of the large serpent of the Garden of 
Eden. It also seems more inclined to bite than to whisper. 
The design of the triangular base with its feet in the form of 
abortive fatheaded dolphins and its weak frieze of floral 
arabesque and its execution_the dolphins and the field of 
the frieze given a punched texture_are typical of the 
workshop of Severo da Ravenna and no doubt suggested to 
Fortnum the idea that it was north Italian of the late fifteenth 
or early sixteenth century. Bode, however, recognized that 
the bronze was a copy of a statuette by Bandinelli (Italian 
Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii. 
18), and perhaps for this reason the base began to look wrong. 
Bell's pencil annotation to Fortnum's large catalogue reads, 
`This misleading addition was removed and replaced by a 
marble plinth 1929' (old photographs show it mounted on 
a block of porto venere, goldveined black marble). By the 
1970s, however, it had become possible to identify the 
products of Severo da Ravenna's workshop and to see that 
the workshop continued in business under the management 
of Severo's son into the second half of the sixteenth century 
using, for the most part, models dating from about 1500. It 
was quite able to take over a model from Bandinelli. 
Consequently Anthony Radcliffe pointed out in a letter of 6 
September 1976 to Christopher Lloyd that the triangular base 
was probably original. The base was found by November 1976 
and was restored in March 1977. Examination of the bronze 
and `Xrays' made from it for Radcliffe and Richard Stone of 
the Metropolitan museum, New York, confirmed that the 
technique of the bronze was entirely consistent with Severo's 
foundry style.
Other versions of the bronze are recorded. One from the 
Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples, was exhibited in 

1961 (Italian Bronze Statuettes (Arts Council, Victoria and 
Albert Museum, London, 1961), no. 106). Another is in the 
Abbott Guggenheim Collection and was exhibited at the Fine 
Arts Museums of San Francisco (L. Camins, Renaissance and 
Baroque Bronzes from the Abbott Guggenheim Collection (San 
Francisco, 1988), 20, no. 3). Three casts of the figure, even 
more coarsely finished and clumsily modelled, with serpents 
in different positions and the women given idiotic smiles, 
combine to form the second lowest set of supporters of a 
sevenstage, threesided, candelabrum (512 feet high) in the 
Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco (61.35), the other 
elements of which are all found in other standard productions 
of Severo da Ravenna's workshop (it looks indeed like a 
compilation designed to cope with a surplus of stock).
The bronze in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, 
Florence (no. 354), from which these versions derive is of 
superior finish and larger_32.2 cms. high (including, 
however, an integral bronze base about 1 cm. high). The 
subject has always been identified as Cleopatra and is one of 
a set of six bronzes identified as by Bandinelli since the 
sixteenth century, two of which (a Venus with a dove and a 
Jason) also bear his name. Of these bronzes, three are larger 
than the Cleopatra (Jason 39.8 cms., Venus with a dove 
37.8 cms., and Hercules 36.1 cms.), but two very close in size 
to it (a Venus 33.3 cms. and a Leda 31.5 cms.). Three engraved 
portraits of Bandinelli show him in the company of similar 
bronze statuettes, and one of these, showing him surrounded 
by students drawing them by candlelight, is inscribed by the 
engraver, Agostino Veneziano, as depicting Bandinelli's 
`academia' in the `luogo detto Belvedere' in 1531. According 
to Vasari's life (Opere, ed. G. Milanesi (Florence, 1906), vi. 
153), it was when he was working in the Vatican Belvedere 
that Bandinelli first made bronze statuettes. This was after 
1529 when he had accompanied Pope Clement VII from 
Bologna to Rome and was making plans for the adornment 
of Castel Sant'Angelo. `To pass the time and to experiment 
with casting technology he made numerous statuettes alte due 
terzi e tonde [``height twothirds of a braccio and in the 
round''_a braccio being for him about 50 cms.] of 
Herculeses, Venuses, Apollinos, Ledas, and other figures of 
his invention [altre sue fantasie] and, having then cast in 
bronze by Maestro Jacopo della Barba of Florence, they came 
out superbly.' Vasari notes that he presented these `to His 
Holiness and to molti signori and some of them are now in 
Duke Cosimo's scrittoio, among over a hundred antique 
pieces, all rarities, and other modern ones'. The Bargello's 
bronzes have a Medici provenance. They may derive from 
models made in about 1530, but Heikamp has shown that 
the Cleopatra was made in 1544, that the Hercules was first 
recorded in 1549, and that the group of six was recorded for 
the first time in detail in an inventory of 1553. Chiarini notes 
that a document of 1550 reveals that three bronze figures by 
Bandinelli belonging to Cosimo I were then in the shop of 
the goldsmiths Domenico and Paolo Poggini who may 

therefore have been responsible for casting them.

Florence, 1980), 319-20, nos. 649-54, entries by M. C. 
[Marco Chiarini]; D. Heikamp, `note' in the edition of 
Vasari's Vite published Milan, 1964, vi. 39.)




Workshop of Michelangelo BARBERI (1787-1867), 148 Via 
Rasella, Rome
10. Circular inlaid slab of `marble' 
specimens serving as a table top
127.7 cms. (diameter of slab); 3.7 cms. (depth of slab); 77 cms. 
(height of table)
Coloured stones are inlaid into a slab of white Carrara marble in a 
geometric pattern of scales radiating in increasing sizes from a 
central micromosaic circle. Each scaleshaped piece of stone is 
outlined in black Belgian marble. The border design is framed in 
white Carrara marble. The coloured stones include imperial 
porphyry, granites, serpentines, alabasters, and semiprecious stones 

as well as marbles. Many are reworked from fragments of ancient 
Roman architecture (for example, the very distinctive bianco e nero 
antico, with its jagged pattern of black and white, the Pyrenean 
quarries of which were only rediscovered in the late nineteenth 
century), easily available in Rome. Others (most notably the brillian 
t 
green malachite from Siberia used for the smallest scales) were 
imported. The slab is supported by a tripod table veneered in 
coromandel with dull gilt metal mounts (perhaps not bronze, 
certainly not firegilt).
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. F. 27 in his catalogues. 
The table top was probably bought in Rome in 1852 (see below).
Table tops composed of numerous types of polished stone_
and especially reusing the stones the ancient Romans had so 
esteemed_were perhaps first produced in Italy in the late 
fifteenth century. A splendid one was made for Isabella d'Este 
in 1499 out of a great variety of stones including serpentine 
and porphyry, and others the names of which were unknown 
(C. M. Brown, ` ``Lo insaciabile desiderio nostro de cose 
antique'': New Documents for Isabella d'Este's Collection 
of Antiquities', in C. H. Clough (ed.), Cultural Aspects of the 
Renaissance: Essays in Honour of Paul Oskar Kristeller 
(Manchester, 1976), 349 n. 53). However, I know of no 
surviving table tops in which a wide variety of stones are 
displayed in a geometric pattern designed as much for 
geological instruction as for ornament, which were made 
before the second half of the eighteenth century. They seem 
to have been a speciality of Roman craftsmen. One such 
litoteca with a curvaceous shape and short ormolu paw feet 
which folds open like a games board was presented in 1763 
by Cardinal Riminaldi to his native Ferrara (Il Museo Civico 
in Ferrara: Donazioni e restauri, ii: Chiesa di San Romano 

(Ferrara, 1985), 139-40). A painting by Laurent PÃ©cheux of 
1777 shows the Marchesa Boccapaduli in her museum 
unveiling a monstrance full of butterflies which is supported 
on an altar, as it were, of marble specimens (reproduced as 
colour plate XVII in A. Gonza~5lezPalacios, Il tempio del gusto 
(Roma e il regno delle Due Sici~5lie), 2 vols. (Milan, 1984) I). 
The tops were at first rectangular and intended for pier tables 
in grand apartments. Lalande in the first edition of his Voyage 
en Italie (Yverdon, 1764, v. 224) mentions such rectangular 
table tops as a novelty. Francesco (III) of Lorrain, husband 
of Maria Teresa of Austria, is depicted with such a table in a 
portrait by Franz Messmer and Ludwig Kohl dated 1773 
(eight years after the emperor's death) which is in the 
Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna, and a very similar table 
is in the Pitti Palace, Florence (A. Gonza~5lezPalacios, Il tempio 
del gusto (La Toscana e l'Italia settentionale), 2 vols. (Milan, 
1986), i. 144, ii. 299-300). By 1787 when Lalande's second 
edition appeared (v. 71) they were clearly a wellestablished 
fashion. A parallel fashion may be observed in gold boxes 
including specimens of hardstones which were a speciality of 
Dresden workshops in the last quarter of the eighteenth 
century.
An early British reference to table tops of this sort comes 
in the sale of the stockintrade of Thomas Carter in 1777 
when a pair of `inlaid studios of marble' were sold for 20 
guineas (Department of Prints and Drawings, British 
Museum, A59, pp. 54-60). In the same year Henry Blundell 
bought a specimen table from a marble dealer in the `Campo 
Vacino' (sic) and was also presented with one by Pope Pius 
VI ([H. Blundell], Account of the Statues, Busts, BassRelieves, 
Cinerary Urns, and Other Ancient Marbles, and Paintings, 
at Ince, collected by H.B. (Liverpool, 1803) ). The majority 
acquired in the late eighteenth century are likely to have been 
purchased by gentlemen on the Grand Tour who had 
throughout the century imported slabs of ancient marble from 
Rome (as well as pietra dura inlay from Florence) for table 
tops.
Circular specimen marble table tops appear to have been 
the nineteenthcentury fashion in Britain. Christopher Gilbert 
(in `A Specimen Marble Table', Connoisseur (Oct. 1973), 78-
81) notes that circular tables with marble, scagliola, mosaic, 
or marble inlay tops were known as Dejune tables, and were 
described in George Smith's Designs for Household Furniture 
of 1808 and in the second edition of his CabinetMaker's and 
Upholsterer's Guide of 1826 as suitable for `ladies Boudoirs or 
Morning Breakfast Rooms' and for `the boudoir or drawing 
rooms'. The circular form when large, however, may always 
have been intended for libraries or galleries. Large or small, 
they are characteristic of the tendency, increasing steadily in 
the early nineteenth century, for furniture to be designed for 
the centre of a room. It was the circular shape which 
stimulated more complex patterns in place of the 
chequerboard.
Two other table tops of the same size and pattern as that 

in the Ashmolean Museum have come to my attention. One 
with a massive rosewood support of about 1850 (combining 
heavy baroque scrolls with Gothic trefoils and Gothic foliage) 
was lot 146 at Christie's, London, 7 May 1987. Another, 
supported by three gilt sphinxes in the Empire style which, 
if original, would date from the first two decades of the 
nineteenth century and would probably have been made in 
France, was illustrated in the Connoisseur for July 1965
(p. 153). In all cases the central feature is a `micromosaic' 
reproduction of the famous ancient mosaic found in Hadrian's 
Villa, and preserved in the Capitoline Museum since 1765, 
representing three doves drinking from a brazen vessel in 
which they are partially reflected. In all cases the first and 
smallest scales are of malachite. There are variations in the 
colours_for example the largest scales are all outlined in 
black against porphyry in the Ashmolean table top but against 
giallo antico in the one at Christie's in 1987. The support of 
the Ashmolean table top with its lion's paw feet and its lion 
masks at the braced centres of its three tense scroll supports 
is an example of early nineteenthcentury British furniture at 
its most bold. It could have been made as early as 1815 or 
as late as 1855.
One Roman workshop known to have made such work is 
that of Giacomo Raffaelli (1753-1836). The smaller inlaid 
table top published in 1973 by Christopher Gilbert (op. 
cit.)_3 feet in diameter_is of similar character. The inlaid 
marble is arranged in a radial pattern forming a star with 
twentyfour outer points, each `scale', however, being 
sharper, and the black borders being legible as continuous 
lines. It is similar also in its use of malachite. A plan and 
description of this table survives which commences with the 
information that it was purchased on 8 March 1831 `from 
the very illustrious Signor Erskine in the establishment of 
Councillor Giacomo Raffaelli Via del Babuino No. 92_near 
the Albert Theatre in Rome'. Raffaelli was councillor to the 
Imperial Russian Court for which he did much work (which 
explains the use of malachite).
Fortnum also owned two smaller tables of this type. One, 
which he bequeathed to E. Maude Thompson (F. 28 in his 
catalogue), had a top of `Florentine mosaic' with a spray of 
flowers in pietra dura. He bought it in 1852 in Florence and 
noted that it was the work of `Cav. Bianchini' of that city. He 
had it mounted in London on an elaborate tripod support 
involving terms of Hercules. Another (F. 29), mounted in a 
similar manner and regarded as a companion, was of `Roman 
mosaic'. It featured a central medallion of `Cupid in the act 
of discharging an arrow from his bow' and was made by 
`Cav. Barberi' of Rome. This latter table, also acquired in 
1852, he bequeathed to Lord Halsbury. In his large catalogue 
Fortnum did not name the maker of the large table top in the 
Ashmolean, but in his notebook catalogue he cites this also 
as the work of Barberi. We may conjecture that it too was 
acquired in 1852 or possibly a little earlier or later, suggesting 
or suggested by his acquisition of the smaller example.

Michelangelo Barberi was the leading practitioner of the 
Roman art of micromosaic pictures in the midnineteenth 
century. Like Raffaelli he had many contacts with Russia. 
Indeed he was a protÃ©gÃ© of the Princess Volkonski and helped 
establish the mosaic school of St Petersburg. Some of his most 
celebrated works_the Trionfo d'Amore of 1826, the Twenty
Four Hours of Rome of 1839_are in the Hermitage. One 
might suppose that he only made the central circle of the 
table top, but there is evidence that mosaicists also supplied 
the larger marble inlay; indeed Giacomo Raffaelli was also 
chiefly known for his micromosaic although one could (as 
we have seen) buy table tops from him without any mosaic 
element. Fortnum could have known of Barberi's work 
without travelling to Rome for it was awarded a medal at the 
Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1856, when appointed 
Commendatore del Pontificio Ordine di S. Silvestro, Barberi 
published engravings of `Alcuni Musaici usciti dallo Studio 
del Cav. Michel 'Angelo Barberi'. (M. Alfieri, M. G. 
Branchetti, D. Petochi, I mosaici minuti romani (Rome, 
1981), 46, 125-30). Two important round micromosaic 
tabletops, with views of major Italian cities in one case and of 
the flora and classical ruins of southern Italy in the other, are 
in the collection of Mr and Mrs Arthur Gilbert and on loan 
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (M.77.1.81 and 
L.88.22.3). The supports are of gilt bronze but otherwise 
similar to that of the Ashmolean table.
Of all the designs reproduced in Roman Micromosaic 
between 1770 and 1870 none exceeded in popularity Pliny's 
Doves (see Alfieri, Branchetti, and Petochi, op. cit., figs. 13 
and 29 and the ten plates on 226-7).

Perhaps studio of Lorenzo BARTOLINI (1777-1850)
11. Mask of Dante Alighieri
22 cms. (approximate height of mask); 57.5 cms. (height of 
shadow box; 44.8 cms. (width of shadow box)
Plaster of Paris. Cast from a piecemould, with all the seams 
preserved_hollow behind. The mask is mounted on a board 
covered with burgundycoloured velvet framed as an irregular oval 
within a rectangular oak frame. The oval aperture is surrounded 
with a carved frieze of laurel leaves with a line of water gilding to 

either side; the laurel berries are also gilded. The oak frame is set 

within an oak shadow box.
Transferred at an unrecorded date from the Bodleian Library where 
it was recorded in the Gallery by Mrs R. Lane Poole in an appendix 
to her Catalogue of Portraits in the Possession of the University, 
Colleges, City and County of Oxford, iii (Oxford, 1925), 308, as 
follows: `Cast of Bertolini's [sic] mask believed to have been taken 

from the mask originally placed on the Poet's Tomb at Ravenna. 
Presented to the Oxford Dante Society by Baron Kirkup in 1879. 
Deposited on loan by the Oxford Dante Society in 1916.'
Dante's admirers were not idle in Oxford in the 1910s. Dr 

Paget Toynbee presented the Bodleian Gallery with a 
collection of `all the portraits' of the poet in 1917, and in 
1919 the Hon. William Vernon added a plaster cast of 
Munro's bust of the poet (the marble, which belonged to 
Henry Acland, had been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 
1856 as no. 1304). The quality of the Ashmolean's cast is 
lamentable and it may have been made by an amateur, the 
taking of `squeezes' during the midnineteenth century often 
being undertaken by gentlemen travellers. The source would 
seem to have been the terracotta bust in Palazzo del Nero in 
Florence which was much venerated in the last century 
because it was believed to have been made from a cast taken 
after the poet's death in Ravenna in 1321. There is a similar 
plaster mask, including, however, less of the cap and with less 
evident seams, in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, the gift of the 
literary critic Senatore Alessandro d'Ancona. This had 
previously belonged to Seymour Kirkup (1788-1880), who 
is recorded as having given the Ashmolean's cast to the Oxford 
Dante Society shortly before his death. Kirkup was a British 
painter resident in Florence whose chief claim to fame was his 
discovery of a presumed portrait of Dante on a wall of the 
Bargello in the early 1840s. There is no record in M. Tinti's 
monograph Lorenzo Bartolini (2 vols. (Rome, 1936) ) of the 
sculptor making a portrait of Dante but it is unlikely that the 
reference to him is without significance and it is possible that 
his studio supplied casts of this and other famous Florentine 
works of art and memorabilia. Bartolini was certainly a strong 
adherent of the view that the Florentine masks were death
masks (which is exceedingly improbable)_see C. Ricci, 
L'ultimo rifugio di Dante (Florence, 1891), 279-80. An 
alternative explanation would be that the cast was in fact 
furnished by Bartolini's rival Stefano Ricci (1765-1837), who 
was responsible for the poet's cenotaph in S. Croce, Florence 
(commissioned in 1829), in which the effigy was based closely 
on the Palazzo del Nero mask.


Unknown foundry, unknown modeller

After Gianlorenzo BERNINI (1598-1680)
12. Constantine the Great 
beholding the sign of the Cross, 
before the Battle of the Milvian 
Bridge
81 cms. (height); 98 cms. (length); 80.2 cms. (height of pedestal); 
92 cms. (length of pedestal)
Bronze with a dark brown to black patina worn to a chestnut brown 
in some salient areas (e.g. horse's forelegs, ridges of drapery). 
Hollow, lostwax, cast in numerous pieces. Both the back legs and 
the tail of the horse were separately cast and fixed with difficultie 
s: 
rivets are apparent and there are cracks in the tail near the join. T 
he 
front legs were separately cast, but fixed with no visible joins. 

Constantine's body is cast in two parts_the upper part including 
both of his arms. The join is apparent on close inspection of the 
cloak. The fit of the lower part of his body on the horse is ingeniou 
s, 
especially where his cloak fits tightly over the saddle cloth below. 

Three of the four tassels on the saddle cloth on each side of the 
horse were separately cast and one is missing from both sides (the 
tassels nearest the horse's neck are integral with the cloth). The st 
rap 
across the horse's chest is also attached. The horse's head is cast 
separately and the join in the upper part of the horse's neck is most 

evident on the emperor's left side but there is a crack along a part 
of 
the join on the other side of the neck. The wall of bronze is very 
thin in the highest portions of the horse as also in the tail with 
minute perforations in these parts. A small patch of the mane appears 

to have been separately inserted. The group is mounted on a pedestal 

of pale mahogany (modelled on that designed by Michelangelo for 
the Marcus Aurelius on the Capitol) by means of solid extensions 
of the back legs.
Purchased 1952 through the agency of Mary Bellis of Charnham 
Close, Hungerford, from the collection of the American newspaper 
tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Purchased for Hearst at the sale 
of Leopold Hirsch deceased of 10 Kensington Palace Gardens, 
London, Christie's, London, 8 May 1934 (lot 151). The present 
pedestal seems to have been made for Hirsch. Previously in the 
collection of T. M. Whitehead and in his sale, Christie's, London, 
10 May 1898 (lot 104), at which date it had an ebonized pedestal 
the top of which was the same shape as the present one. Said in this 

sale to have been brought from Rome in 1855 by T. W. Faulkner, 
Esq., of Lime Bank, Cheetham Hill, near Manchester. Mary Bellis 
was a dealer in antique furniture who had for a brief while a special 

arrangement to sell works of art from Hearst's home in Wales, St 
Donat's Castle. See also Nos. 130 and 416.
Bernini's colossal marble statue, upon which this bronze is 
modelled, is placed, as if in high relief, against the wall of the 
principal landing of the Scala Regia in the Vatican Palace. It 
had first been conceived of in the autumn of 1654 in response 
to an idea of Pope Innocent X to fill a niche in the Basilica of 
St Peter's and had been blocked out by 1655 when Alexander 
VII became pope and plans were changed. The present 
location was decided upon in 1662 and the statue was finished 
in the summer of 1668, transported by January 1669, and 
unveiled, against a background of agitated stucco drapery, 
on 1 November 1670. (R. Wittkower, Bernini (Oxford, 
1981), 251-4.)
The Ashmolean's bronze is a work of high quality 
suggestive of a diplomatic gift. It is also the only recorded 

version in bronze of this masterpiece by Bernini. It is not a 
copy. The horse rears rather less high than in Bernini's marble 
and the emperor's right arm is lower (so that his gesture is 
closer to that devised by Raphael for the mural of the same 
subject in the Sala di Costantino of the Vatican). Some of the 
differences_the trappings on the horse and the antique 
armour here worn by Constantine_may be explained as 
appropriate for a less monumental setting, a more ornamental 
purpose, and perhaps a scholarly patron. Other differences 
may be explained by the different medium: the tail in the 
marble version is attached to the rump and legs, whereas in 
the bronze it flows free; likewise the cloak in the bronze, 
where blown back over the flank of the horse, does not adhere 
as closely to it as in the marble version. None of the differences 
observed so far precludes the possibility that this is a work 
made from a modello by Bernini himself. In one or two 
respects (above all the cuirass) the bronze does correspond 
with a damaged terracotta bozzetto by Bernini in the 
Hermitage (G. Matzulevitsch, `Tre bozzetti di G. L. Bernini', 
Bolletino d'arte (1963), 71-2, fig, 3).
It is, however, far more likely that the bronze is the work 
of a later sculptor. Wittkower (op. cit. 254) suggested the 
Florentine Giovanni Battista Foggini, who studied in Rome, 
between 1673 and 1676, under Ercole Ferrata_`the sculptor 
may have used a Bernini bozzetto as a starting point for his 
version'. The suggestion is attractive both because Foggini 
was much involved in equestrian groups in bronze (indeed 
his Kaiser Joseph I in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, 
Munich, and his Carlos II in the Prado, Madrid, both have 
rearing mounts) and because the complex piecing of the 
bronze is typical of Florentine foundries of the late seventeenth 
and early eighteenth centuries. They were, however, more 
ingenious in concealing joins. Other sculptors working in 
Rome (including pensioners of the French Academy) could 
have been responsible.
The bronze may be considered as a correction of, as well 
as homage to, the marble, for it avoids the controversial 
mannerisms of Bernini's late style. The cloak is less abstract 
in its agitation, more like cloth in its weight, and the horse's 
mane is less extravagant. The alteration of the emperor's 
attitude may reflect apprehension concerning the decorum 
of Bernini's interpretation which is expressed in a polemical 
pamphlet on the sculptor which deplored the way in which 
Constantine resembled St Francis receiving the Stigmata (G. 
Previtali, `Il Costantino messo alla Berlina o Bernina . . .', 
Paragone, 13 (1962), 55-8, no. 145).


Workshop of BONGIOVANNI-VACCARO
13. Young country woman with an 
infant in conversation with an older 
country man
23 cms. (height); 21.8 cms. (length); 12.9 cms. (width)
Terracotta, partially hollow. Minor firing cracks; many subsequent 

breaks. The whole of the man's left arm, the index finger of the 
woman's left hand, and the end of her thumb, also the child's left 
foot are missing. His bundle is broken at one end (a relatively recen 
t 
loss). The base is cracked across the front and repaired in the inter 
ior 
with cement, small patches of which are smeared on the front. 
Inscribed `1978.334' in red letters in the interior.
Given by G. R. Reitlinger in 1972. The gift, exceptionally, remained 

in Reitlinger's possession. Much was lost in the fire of 6 February 
1978 at his home. What was salvaged was removed to the Museum. 
The donor died on 8 March 1978. The number corresponds to a 
card index of some 225 Western ceramic items transferred from the 
Department of Eastern Art. These were never registered. The card 
for this piece includes Reitlinger's number E. 336 and a note that 
it was bought at Phillips and Harris on 3 February 1970.
Reitlinger identified this group as modelled by `Bongiovanni 
Vaccaro' about 1840-60. Salvatore and Giacomo 
Bongiovanni (born 1769 and 1772 respectively) had 
established a workshop for the making of small terracotta 
figurines for cribs and the like at Caltagirone in Sicily by the 
end of the eighteenth century. Their sister's son, Giuseppe 
Vaccaro, continued with, and further improved upon, their 
work, and other members of the family were also employed. 
Their most ambitious cribs included numerous rural types in 
local dress, as had long been traditional in southern Italy. 
Many of these were occupied in a manner quite unrelated to 
the sacred narrative and these groups_the shepherds making 
ricotta, the women washing linen in a stream, the old women 
winding wool, and so on_could presumably also be 
purchased independently by tourists. The finest compendium 
of their models is to be found in the crib in the Real Collegiata 
di S. Maria de Betlem in Modica (Sicily) unveiled on Christmas 
Eve 1882 (C. Naselli, `Presepi di Sicilia', Emporium, 74 
(1931), 332-7). Scholars who have seen this and the 
independent figures in Sicilian museums have confirmed the 
attribution of this piece to the Bongiovanni-Vaccaro 
workshop, whose productions seem however to have usually 
been coloured. The style, and extremely skilful management 
of petals of clay for the ragged clothes, are very closely 
matched in a piece representing a pedlar or beggar which is 
stamped `BONGIOVANNI VACCARO' with raised letters on its 
base (reproduced Emporium, 34 (1911), 310), and may also 
be compared with a group of cobblers and a figure of a 
`contadino di Bronte' in the collection of crib figures in the 
Bayerischers Nationalmuseum, Munich (vitrine no. 120). 
Work of this kind was still being made in Caltagirone in this 
century, by when, however, the standards of modelling had 
declined. The subjects still continue to be popular, and not 
only in Sicily_the `Eleganza Collection of Seattle', which 
sells reproductions of Renaissance and classical masterpieces 
in oxolyte, also supplies the ItalianAmerican market with the 
Contadino con cesti de frutta, the Giustapiatti, Pizzamakers, 

and other street vendors in this tradition.


Workshop of BONGIOVANNI-VACCARO
14. Pedlar or vagrant in traditional 
Sicilian dress
18.6 cms. (height); 6 cms. (widest diameter of irregular oval base); 

1.6 cms; (height of same)
Terracotta, partially hollow. Minute chips and firing cracks.
Given by R. E. Alton of St Edmund Hall. Registered 23 March 
1962.
The piece is unmarked but has long been stored with No. 13, 
to which it is very closely related in style and technique. On 
registration it was described as Neapolitan but later attributed 
to the French sculptor Leopold HarzÃ© of Lie~6ge (1851-93).

Giuseppe BOSCHI (active 1790s)
15. Portrait bust of Cicero
22.2 cms. (height of bust); 10 cms. (width across truncation of 
chest); 6.9 cms. (height of socle); 9.8 cms. (diameter of socle)
Bronze with a dark greenbrown patina, worn to chestnut on a few 
salient points (e.g. tip of nose and lips). Hollow, lostwax, cast. 
Mounted on a turned and waisted socle of bronze, firegilt, with a 
label chiselled `M. T. CICERO'. An integrally cast bronze tang 
projecting from the inside of the chest serves as an attachment. The 

bust is incised, apparently in the model, along the edge behind the 
neck: `G. BOSCHI ~^@ F. ROMAE. 1793'. Painted in the hollow interior 
of 
the bust to proper left in white `B / 407. / .' The socle has been 
filled with plaster of Paris to give it weight.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 407 in his catalogues. 
Bought in Rome for Â£2 in 1870.
Boschi is described by Charles Heathcote Tatham in a letter 
of 10 July 1795 to his patron the architect Henry Holland as 
an `obscure' artist but one who was recommended by 
`Madame Angelica [Kauffmann], Zucchi her husband, 
Canova, Visconti and Bonomi' (Tatham papers, Victoria and 
Albert Museum). Tatham, who was supplying Holland with 
ideas and items for furnishing his interiors, noted that Boschi 
was much cheaper for work in bronze and ormolu than were 
the betterknown Righetti (see Nos. 79-81) and Valadier 
whose workshops were evidently extensive. But this, Tatham 
continued, was explained by the fact that Boschi was `himself 
the artist, and not a principal' (i.e. an entrepreneur). We 
know of few other works signed by Boschi and little has been 
attributed to him. A small bronze version of Canova's Hebe 
signed by him was lot 193 at Christie's, London, 11 December 
1979, one of the lion on Canova's tomb of Pope 

Clement XIII was lot 131 at Sotheby's, London 12 April 
1990, and one of the Marcus Aurelius was lot 146 at 
Sotheby's, London, 4 July 1984. A pair of busts of Achilles 
and Ajax, both after the antique were lot 89 at Christie's, 
London, 10 December 1991 (the bold signatures, `G. 
BOSCHI F.', not noted in the catalogue). Gordon 
Balderston has drawn to my attention a small bronze group 
of a centurion in a twohorsed chariot signed by him (in a 
private collection). D. Udy, in his catalogue of his stand at 
the Grosvenor House Antique Dealers Fair, 1966, and 
Christie's (with Young and Gilling), Hawling Manor, 
Gloucestershire, 10 October 1988, lot 7, draw attention to 
small ormolu versions of the Farnese candelabra now in Naples 
perhaps commissioned by Tatham. A pair of portrait busts of 
the older and younger Brutus with a finish and technique like 
the Cicero, of the same size and mounted upon the same type 
of socle, are displayed as `French?' and of about 1800 in the 
Sta~8dtische Galerie Liebieghaus, Frankfurt on Main.
There were three ancient busts believed (possibly correctly, 
it is conceded today) to be portraits of Cicero which Boschi 
might have taken as his model. The most famous of these was 
the one later acquired by the duke of Wellington from 
Cardinal Fesch which had been in the Mattei Collection since 
the sixteenth century (A. Michaelis, Ancient Marbles in Great 
Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 429-30). This shows the 
philosopher with a bare chest and a marble tablet beneath 
the chest bearing the name Cicero in lettering which although 
ancient is thought to be less so than the bust. There are, 
however, small differences: in the parting of the lips, the curls 
of hair beside the ear, and, more importantly, the corrugations 
of the brow. There is a closer resemblance to the head in the 
Capitoline Museum (Sala dei Filosofi, no. 75) which had been 
in the Barberini Collection_a portrait believed by Visconti 
to be of Maecenas (Iconografia romana, i (Milan edition of 
his Works, 1818-37), 171, pl. 12), and a still closer 
resemblance to the head in the Uffizi probably acquired from 
the Ludovisi Collection by Grand Duke Ferdinand II de' 
Medici in 1669 (G. Mansuelli, Galleria degli Uffizi: Le 
sculture, 2 vols. (Rome, 1958-61), ii. 44-5, no. 33), which 
is set in lavish onyx drapery. It seems likely that Boschi had 
access to a cast of the latter.

Perhaps by Giuseppe BOSCHI (active 1790s)
16. Bust of Juno
24 cms. (height); 16.8 cms. (length, across shoulders)
Bronze with a mixed olive green to chestnut patina. Hollow, lost
wax, cast. `B. / 406. / .' Painted in white in the hollow interior 
to proper right.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 406 in his catalogues. 
No indication of provenance but presumably acquired after 1857 
when the preliminary catalogue, in which this is not included, was 
compiled. Mounted, when in Fortnum's possession, on a `giallo 

base' (no doubt a socle of giallo antico).
The attribution of this bronze to Righetti was made by 
Fortnum presumably because of its similarity in technique, 
character, and colour to those busts of Bacchus and Ariadne 
in his collection which are chiselled with Righetti's name 
(Nos. 80 and 81). In the large catalogue he claims that the 
bust is after an antique marble in the Vatican but I cannot 
find a similar statue there. The prototype may be in this 
country, for in Righetti's printed list of bronzes dated 1794 
under `Bustes avec leur base dorÃ©e, en tout, hauts d'un palme, 
cinq onces' we find `La fameuse Junon colossale en 
Angleterre' companion with `Le Jupiter du Museum Vatican'. 
The measurement of this bronze Juno, which would only 
have been approximate, was the same as that for the Bacchus 
and Ariadne, although at 15 `Sequins Romains' (nearly 
Â£7 10s.) it was more expensive. The size of the Ashmolean 
Juno is close to that of the Bacchus and Ariadne. It is however 
impossible to feel sure that the bust is not the product of one 
of the rival foundries of the period. It is different in the 
cutting of the chest and the modelling has less vitality especially 
when compared with the Ariadne. An attribution to Boschi 
is advanced on the grounds that two other versions of the 
bust are found as companions to versions of the Cicero, which 
is (in the Ashmolean's example, No. 15) signed by Boschi. In 
both cases, one in a private collection in London and one 
with a French dealer from whom they were stolen in late July 
1989 (see the Gazette de l'Ho~7tel Drouot (Sept. 1989), 56), 
the socles were of gilt bronze of the same type as the 
Ashmolean's Cicero.


Perhaps by Cesare BRAZZINI (active 1870s)
17. Bust of a boy of the Medici family
46.2 cms. (height)
Terracotta of a pinky grey colour, dirty. There is a network of cracks and breaks over the chest, with some plaster infill tinted to match the clay. Much plaster has been poured into the hollow interior of the bust to reinforce it. There is a small hole in the top of the head. 
Slipcast and retaining many minute seams from the piecemould: 
e.g. across his right eyebrow, across front of fringe.
Given by Thomas Harris of Garden Lodge, Logan Place, London 
W8. Registered 25 October 1947.
The Register records that the donor believed that the bust 
was cast from an eighteenthcentury mould of an earlier 
original. Another version of the bust is in the Victoria and 
Albert Museum (no. 2311876). There is no surviving 
documentation for the latter save that it was acquired in 1876 
as a bust of `Il Moro' from a Cesare Brazzini in Florence. If 
this is the name of a sculptor he is not otherwise recorded, 
and it may rather be the name of a dealer. The Medici family 
palle on the breastplate and the coronet above would suggest 

that a Medici duke was intended, and, given the youth of the 
sitter and his scowl, there can be little doubt that he is meant 
for the first Medici duke of Florence, Alessandro de' Medici, 
natural son of Lorenzo, duke of Urbino. Alessandro was made 
ruler of Florence in 1530 by the imperial army at the age of 
20 and died, murdered by his kinsman, after seven years' rule, 
the horror of which thrilled the city's late Victorian historians: 
`The exaltation of this foul and evil youth to a position of 
power absolutely uncontrolled showed mankind an example 
of what human nature is capable of under such conditions', 
wrote Colonel Young (The Medici (New York, 1910), 365), 
and he proceeded to quote Adolphus Trollope on the `low 
forehead and mean expression' of this boy whose life was one 
`continual orgy'. The bust mixes elements suggestive of 
fifteenthcentury sources_the puddingbasin hair style, the 
ornamental breastplate, and the proud look derive chiefly 
perhaps from Pollaiuolo's terracotta bust of an unknown 
youth, no. 166 in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, 
Florence_with others contemporary with the sitter_the 
mask ornament on the front face of the base is inspired by 
that on the armour of Michelangelo's Giuliano de' Medici_
see no. 62). At the same time the boy seems unmistakably to 
be a contemporary of the fisherboys and urchins of Vincenzo 
Gemito.
The Victoria and Albert Museum version is exhibited 
among their fakes but it is not certain that the portrait was 
intended as such rather than as an imaginary portrait. It is 
covered, like the Ashmolean version, with piecemould seams 
but seems to have been fired in two parts, the back of the 
head, neck, and shoulders forming a `lid' cemented on to the 
rest.


Probably by Elias de Witte, called Elia CANDIDO (active 
1570s in Florence)
18 and 19. Pair of putti in twisted 
attitudes
19.5 cms. (length of figure (18) with arm behind his head); 
22.1 cms. (length of figure (19) )
Bronze with a black varnish (leaving a dark green deposit when 
handled), worn, on salient points such as curls, nose, knees, toes, 
and buttocks, to expose a natural warm coppery brown patina. The 
surface has been punched and the varnish is better preserved in the 
small dents, giving a spotty appearance, particularly evident in the 

figure with one hand behind his head (No. 18). Extremely heavy, 
apparently solid, casts. The thickness of the bronze is evident from 

the depth of the large screw holes (perhaps for suspension) of which 

there is one in the back and one between the legs of No. 18 and 
one in the back and one in the back of the proper right thigh of 
No. 19. These holes are over 1 cm. in depth and do not enter into 
a hollow core. The proper left hand of No. 19 has been cast 

separately and the join at the wrist is easily perceived and is sligh 
tly 
loose. There is a small firing crack on the proper right foot and 
above the proper left knee of No. 19.
Given by E. Barry Bowyer of Mulberry House, Peppard, Henley on 
Thames, through R. M. Courtier of 70 Peppard Road, Caversham, 
Reading, Berkshire, in March 1984 (deposited early in March, 
formerly offered and accepted on 15 March). Mr Bowyer died in 
April, soon after making this gift. Mr Courtier, in a letter to the 
Keeper of 6 November 1986, explained that Mr Bowyer was a 
`bachelor, retired some years as senior partner of the firm Buckland 

and Sons, Auctioneers and Surveyors of Slough, Windsor and 
Reading', who had `spent a long life time collecting pictures & 
objects d'art, some from his sales but many from secondhand ``junk 
shops''. If all were not in perfect condition everything had an intri 
nsic 
beauty, or antique value; only in his later years did he spend real 
money! The putti referred to were bought in a very shabby second 
hand shop in Oxford Rd., Reading in about 1970.' This last date, 
however, is inaccurate since Mr Bowyer had been in correspondence 
with the Department of Architecture and Sculpture at the Victoria 
and Albert Museum concerning the putti in February and March 
1956. The department had expressed a tentative interest in 
purchasing them but only for a `modest sum' and Mr Bowyer 
decided not to sell to them.
It is hard to imagine the larger work of art from which these 
putti must have been removed. Although of identical style 
and technique they do not certainly form a pair, No. 18 being 
smaller, most obviously in the head, than No. 19. They may 
be from a larger group in which such differences mattered less 
or were intended. Paired putti of about this size, leaning 
backwards and with one knee raised, sometimes adorn the 
scrolled feet of sixteenth and seventeenthcentury Venetian 
andirons (see for instance those in the Nelson-Atkins 
Museum, Kansas City, 6219/1.2). The positions of the arms 
and the fragments in the hands, however, make such an origin 
unlikely. No. 18 has a piece of drapery in the hands behind 
his head and a stem in the other. No. 19 holds thin, striated 
pieces of foliage or possibly hair in both of his hands. This 
perhaps suggests that the figures originally held up swags or 
held back drapery upon the cornice or upper portion of a 
tabernacle. They bear some resemblance in character to the 
larger bronze putti supporting the epitaph below the half
length portrait of Lucrezia Tomacelli (duchess of Palliana, 
wife of Filippo Colonna) on her tomb in the Colonna Chapel 
in S. Giovanni in Laterano, Rome, a work dated 1625 and 
made by Teodoro della Porta (legitimate son and heir of 
Guglielmo della Porta) in collaboration with the founder 
Giacomo Laurenziani (illustrated and discussed by
U. Middeldorf, Raccolta di scritti (Florence, 1981), iii.
97-8, fig. 93).
The putti were registered as German and of the seventeenth 
or eighteenth century, following the opinion of them 

expressed in a letter to the donor from the Victoria and Albert 
Museum in 1956, but the closest parallel is certainly with 
bronzes which were made in Italy, and in particular with a 
pair of dancing putti upon small domed bases, of similar size. 
One of these, with his left foot raised before him, is in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 1091910) and the other, 
with his left foot behind him, is in the Museo Nazionale of 
the Bargello, Florence (inv. 64). They have similarly active 
and twisted poses, identical wild pointed curls, their 
extremities also appear to have been clipped off to form sharp 
points, and the flesh has been given the same distinctive finish 
with a broad punch. They even have similar fragments in the 
hands_probably bits of stem and leaf. (The Victoria and 
Albert Museum has a variant of the Bargello Bronze (A. 78
1951) and other versions are known, for which see the 
catalogue of the exhibition Giambologna: Ein Wendepunkt 
der europa~8ischen Plastik (Vienna, 1978), nos. 255-6, which, 
however, does not mention the version of the Bargello's putti 
in the Thiers Collection (no. 131) in the Louvre.) These 
dancing figures have been attributed to Elia Candido, Elias 
de Witte of Bruges, because of their resemblance to the larger 
bronze Aeolus in the Studiolo of the Palazzo Vecchio in 
Florence which is inscribed with this mysterious sculptor's 
name and dated 1573. Anthony Radcliffe (in the Vienna 
catalogue cited above) did not find the similarities sufficiently 
strong to justify the attribution. But the precarious and 
spiralling pose is extreme in both and the treatment of the 
hair is very idiosyncratic and exactly comparable. Moreover 
there is another bronze which shares much with both the 
dancing putti and the adolescent wind god. This is the 
graceful Meleager (Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem, 
inv. 2594), similar in size to the former (but even smaller) 
and similar in subject to the latter, who is as delicately balanced 
(with one foot on a boar's head) and has exactly the same 
pointed hair and dimpled flesh as the putti (see the persuasive 
entry by Volker Krahn in Maecenas und Berlin (Ausstellung 
des KaiserFriedrichMuseumsVereins, 1988), 16-17, 
attributing this to Candido).


Pupil of Antonio CANOVA (midnineteenth century)
20. Melpomene
41.2 cms. (height excluding socle); 13 cms. (height of socle)
Carrara marble. The turned and waisted socle is of a different piece 

of marble with the chiselled word `MELPOMENE' on the front of the 
tablet above the upper moulding. Inscribed on the back of this tablet 

in black ink `S 36 '. A few minor chips are missing from the vine 
leaves in the hair.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S. 36 in his catalogues. 
Acquired with Thalia (No. 3).
The Melpomene is companion to Thalia (No. 3), this couple 
forming a pair for the two copies of antique heads by Gott 

(Nos. 514, 515). Fortnum noted that it was a `copy from the 
head of the antique statue in the Vatican . . . the work of a 
student pupil in Canova's studio' but in his preliminary 
catalogue of 1857 (p. 7) he phrased this rather differently: 
`Said to be by one of Canova's pupils and from his studio.' 
One might suppose that this was supplied by Amici together 
with the Thalia (No. 3), but if so it is surprising that the 
socles are of slightly different dimensions and character (and 
that Thalia does not have her name on the tablet). It may 
also be that this particular bust was cut down from a failed 
copy of the entire statue because it is crudely chiselled and 
hardly at all hollowed out behind and is even rough under 
the cut of the chest. Like the Thalia the Melpomene is, in 
execution, an improvement upon the antique prototype, the 
vine leaves and grape clusters of the Bacchic crown being 
more sharply defined and deeply undercut and far more 
completely carved from behind. This prototype is a standing 
figure with her left leg raised on a block holding a mask in 
her right hand in the Sala delle Muse in the Museo Pio
Clementino. It was discovered together wth the Thalia and 
other Muses at the supposed Villa di Cassio at Tivoli in 
excavations commenced before 1773 by Domenico de 
Angelis and was obtained for the papal museum by the 
intervention of GiovanniBattista Visconti in 1774
(W. Amelung and G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen des 
Vaticanischen Museums, III, (Berlin, 1935-6), no. 499;
C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichita~6 sotto il pontificato
di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 139-40).


Perhaps by Benvenuto CELLINI (1500-71)
21. Reclining female nude
8.55 cms. (height); 10.8 cms. (length); 3.7 cms. (height of 
porphyry slab); 12.3 cms. (length of porphyry slab); 5.4 cms. 
(width of porphyry slab); 1.5 cms. (height of wooden plinth); 
13.5 cms. (length of wooden plinth); 8.7 cms. (width of wooden 
plinth)
Bronze with a green and dark brown varnish, flaked and rubbed to 
expose, in many areas, a yellow metal. The nipples are both of silver 
, 
and so is the figure's left eye. The silver has fallen out of her rig 
ht 
eye. The figure's right arm, where it is broken, is solid. Her right 
leg 
appears solid but has been filled with wax to give this impression. 
The thin wall of the bronze above the break has been twisted and 
bent. There is a firing crack in the upper part of the figure's left 

arm. The bronze has been tooled and the cloth which is part of the 
coiffure has been minutely punched. The figure is mounted by means 
of a coarse bolt to a slab of imperial porphyry which rests in a plin 
th 
of ebonized wood. The slab may originally have served as a plinth 
for another bronze in the Chamber Hall gift (see No. 223).

Given by Chambers Hall in 1855 (for this gift see the Preliminary 
Essay to volume iii). Probably placed on display in 1856: blocks for 

mounting the bronzes were paid for in January of that year.
This fragment of an exquisite bronze figure, known only in 
this cast, was formerly labelled as possibly by Guglielmo della 
Porta, because the reclining pose was thought to be similar 
to those of the personifications on the tomb of Pope Paul III 
by that sculptor in St Peter's. This attribution was probably 
proposed, and certainly approved, by C. F. Bell. It was, 
however, Bode's opinion that the figure, which he erroneously 
captioned as in the Pierpont Morgan Collection, might be by 
Benvenuto Cellini (Italian Bronze Statuettes of the 
Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii, pl. CXLVI). Planiscig 
agreed, although correspondence with Bell makes it clear that 
he knew the bronze only from photographs (Piccoli bronzi 
italiani del Rinascimento (Milan, 1930), 45). PopeHennessy 
also considered it as possibly by Cellini (The Life of Benvenuto 
Cellini Written by Himself (London, 1949), 484) and has 
recently reaffirmed this position:
One small bronze of a reclining female nude, which exists only in a 
single version at Oxford may also have been produced by Cellini at 
this time [1546]. It has no provenance (no provenance of 
consequence, that is), but the exquisite modelling of the figure is 
so closely related to the Earth on the Vienna saltcellar as to permit 

a tentative attribution to Cellini. (Cellini (London, 1985), 226)
The somewhat elongated proportions; the pose, intermediary 
between reclining and sitting, which is certainly reminiscent 
of the seesaw attitudes of Ops and Neptune on the saltcellar; 
the elaborately dressed hair which nevertheless retains 
freedom, body, and softness; also the exquisite silver additions 
characteristic of goldsmith's work; all tend to support the 
connection with Cellini. Two factors, however, weigh against 
the attribution. Firstly, Cellini's surviving bronzes, large and 
small, are all of a highly coppery metal with a warm brown 
natural patina, whereas this is the colour of brass. Secondly, 
the woman's face with its pointed dimpled chin and its arched 
brows rising from a fine nose is dissimilar to the female type 
which is found in Cellini's work which is particularly 
distinguished by square brows. It may be significant that 
before the compilation of this catalogue no photographs of 
the bronze gave a frontal view of the face. Draper, in his 
1980 edition of Bode's Italian Bronze Statuettes of the 
Renaissance, suggested that the bronze was Roman and of 
about 1570-80.
It is not only the identity of the creator of this bronze 
which is mysterious. Its original purpose and setting are also 
hard to imagine. It perhaps served as an ornament on an 
elaborate inkstand. It is impossible to believe that a sculpture 
would have been so highly finished in a fragmentary form so 
the damage must have occurred subsequently. It is possible 
to imagine a firing crack in the arm, especially if it were solid, 
causing it to break in half when dropped, and it is easy to 

imagine that the leg, being so thin, could be broken. It is 
odd, however, to find a cast with such an extreme variation 
in thickness.

Giuseppe (Joseph) CLAUS (active between 1754 and 1783)
22, 23, 24, and 25. Popes Innocent 
XIII, Benedict XIII, Clement XII, 
and Benedict XIV
74.5 cms., 72.8 cms., 73.2 cms., 72 cms. (heights of busts, 
excluding socles); 19.5 cms. (height of each socle)
White Carrara marble mounted on mottled dove grey marble socles. 
The knotted cords attaching the stole have, in each bust, save that 
of Innocent XIII (22), been broken and the parts are missing. There 
are small chips missing from the lowest portions of the stoles in the 

busts of Popes Benedict XIII and Clement XII (23 and 24) and on 
the fur fringe of the mozzetta (short, hooded, buttoned cape) of 
Pope Benedict XIV (25) to proper left. The busts are all chiselled 
with cursive letters of the `rims' of marble above the hollowed backs 

as follows: `joseph Claus fecit anno 1754' (on that of Benedict XIV); 

`Claus jnven. et fecit anno 1755' (on that of Innocent XIII); `joseph 

Claus jnven. et fecit anno 1755' (on those of Clement XII and 
Clement XIII). The socles are adorned with the names of the popes 
and of the artist in gold letters (applied since acquisition by the 
Museum). It cannot be certain that the socles are original. For the 
pedestals upon which they are placed see Nos: 219-22.
Bought at Christie's, London, 22 June 1950, lot 67, `the property 
of Frances, Lady Ashburton'. Acquired by Alexander Hugh Baring, 
4th Baron Ashburton, between 1860 and 1889 (probably nearer the 
latter date).
Tantalizingly little is known of Claus. In addition to these 
busts, there is a reduced marble copy of the Apollino of the 
Tribuna signed `Josephus Claus fecit 1766' at Brocklesby 
Park, Lincolnshire, a bust signed by him at Maddesfield Court 
(note in the Department's files), a bust of a man at the Rhode 
Island School of Design, Providence, and a bust of Clement 
Augustus, archbishop elector of Cologne (1700-61), signed 
`Joseph Claus invt. et fect. 1754', in the Lady Lever Art 
Gallery, Port Sunlight (E. Morris and M. Evans, Lady Lever 
Art Gallery, Port Sunlight: Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, 
Drawings, Miniatures, Tapestries, PostClassical Sculpture 
and Prints (Liverpool, 1983), 109, no. LL202, X4202). 
Gerald Taylor has observed (`Uno scultore ignoto Joseph 
Claus', Bollettino d'arte, 3 (July-Sept. 1952), 231-3) that 
Claus is not mentioned in the records of the Academy of 
St Luke. This might suggest that he stayed for only a relatively 
short period in Rome-at least a brief visit is suggested by the 
portrait busts of the popes, and by the style of his work. His 
name suggests that he came from Germany and the portrait 
of the archbishop elector, a lover of Italian art, might suggest 
a patron by whom he was sent to Rome. However, as Hugh 

Honour pointed out in a letter to Hugh Macandrew of 
27 July 1969, it was from a Giuseppe Claus that Canova took 
over a largish studio in Vicolo delle Colonette di S. Giacomo 
degli Incurabili in 1783 in order to carve the monument to 
Pope Clement XIV. If this is the same Claus one wonders 
how he was employed in Rome between 1766 and 1783.
The popes depicted are Innocent XIII (Conti) who died 
1724, Benedict XIII (Orsini) who died 1730, Clement XII 
(Corsini) who died 1740, and Benedict XIV (Lambertini) 
who died 1758. The last named pope was therefore alive 
when the bust of him was carved whereas the others were 
posthumous, and this might explain (as Taylor pointed out, 
op. cit.) the different styles of signature, `invenit' being absent 
from the portrait of the living pope because invention was less 
important when a work was executed from the life. On the 
other hand the sculptor might have wished to underline the 
imaginative contribution he made in those cases when he was 
inevitably dependent upon the models of earlier artists. He 
certainly was dependent upon the bronze bust of Clement 
XII by Pietro Bracci in the Museo Capitolino of 1736 for his 
portrait of that pontiff (as Taylor noted). However 
physiognomical truth seems to have been modified in the 
interest of decorative symmetry. Claus's Benedict XIV 
resembles Innocent XIII and Benedict XIII resembles 
Clement XII. All four have a very similar undulating 
termination to the mozzetta which in every case is imperfectly 
buttoned and each pope has a similarly curling collar in every 
case supported by marble bridges, but on closer examination 
they are paired in attire as well as facial type: Benedict XIV 
and Innocent XIII have polished marble (for satin?) mozzettas 
and caps whereas the busts of Benedict XIII and Clement XII 
have mozzettas and caps with rougher punched textures (for 
velvet ?); the former pair have stoles with a punched ground 
whereas the latter pair wear stoles with a striated ground.
Strikingly similar to these busts, not only in formal, 
costume, and size but in execution, is that of Clement XIV 
now in the Vestibolo Quadrato (formerly Stanza della 
Cleopatra) in the Vatican Museums, which was acquired 
earlier in this century from the Galleria Sangiorgi (with an 
attribution to Canova which now seems absurd).
In addition, the bust of Benedict XIV in the Castello 
Sforzesco in Milan (no. 1314) is a truncated version of that 
in the Ashmolean and so perhaps a product of Claus's studio.


Imitator of DESIDERIO DA SETTIGNANO (b. c.1430, 
d. 1464)
26. Virgin and Child
63.5 cms. (height); 39.5 cms. (width)
White marble, presumably from Carrara, with some ingrained dirt 
in the finer hollows. Framed in a wood frame partially black and 
partially gilded.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. S. 7 in his catalogues. 
Bought in 1864 from the executors of `the late Sig. Lombardi' 

[Francesco Lombardi] for Â£20 (according to the notebook 
catalogue). As mentioned in the introduction Fortnum also bought 
Italian paintings from Lombardi's collection.
Fortnum considered that `the delicate and tender expression 
and fine execution of this marble are much in the manner of 
Desiderio'. In the notebook catalogue it is clear that the 
`much' replaced a `quite' and that the prudent qualification 
that it `may be by some equally able pupil of Donatello's 
school' was an afterthought. He was aware of another version 
of the relief in the Galleria Reale, Turin, which he described, 
rashly, as a copy or `replica'. The Turin Madonna is now 
generally (and surely correctly) regarded as a masterpiece by 
Desiderio: N. Gabrielli's opinion in her catalogue of that 
collection (Galleria Sabauda: Maestri italiani (Turin, 1971), 
261, no. 167) that it is an imitation by Bastianini has not met 
with support. It was bought in Florence by Baron Garriod in 
1850 and casts may well have been taken from it in this 
period. In any case numerous stucco reproductions of it exist, 
most of them purporting to be, and many of them certainly 
looking like, fifteenthcentury works (see L. Cardellini, 
Desiderio da Settignano (Milan, 1962), figs. 369-74). From 
one of these Fortnum's version could easily have been carved.
Bell, in his annotations to Fortnum's large catalogue, 
recorded Bode's opinion that the Ashmolean's relief was a 
`modern copy', and noted the great superiority of the relief 
in Turin, but he kept the piece on display in the Fortnum 
Gallery and in his Summary Guide of 1931 described it as 
`school of Desiderio da Settignano' (p. 23). Kenneth Garlick 
informed Anthony Radcliffe in a letter of 19 October 1973 
that he had just put it up in the redecorated Fortnum 
Gallery_`for better or for worse'. Radcliffe was then helping 
John PopeHennessy's research into the forging of Florentine 
quattrocento sculpture, research which resulted in Pope
Hennessy's paper, first published in Apollo in 1974, entitled 
`The Forging of Italian Renaissance Sculpture', in which 
Bode's opinion that the relief was a fake was repeated. `The 
relief differs', PopeHennessy correctly observes, from that in 
Turin, `in the overall flattening of the forms, e.g. of the drapery 
beneath the Virgin's right forearm and of the Child's right 
hand, and in the misunderstanding of certain passages, e.g. 
in the decoration of the Virgin's dress on the right shoulder 
and the buttoning of her sleeve, represented with a third 
button and a seam that are not present in the original.'
(J. PopeHennessy, The Study and Criticism of Italian 
Sculpture (Princeton, NJ, 1980), 267 n. 30.) The argument 
that the variations were stimulated by deficiencies in a cast of 
the original in Turin is persuasive. The relief certainly looks 
like a copy and probably (but not certainly) of the mid
nineteenth century, rather than of the fifteenth. Whether, if 
it is of the midnineteenth century, it was made to deceive, it 
is impossible to ascertain. For Lombardi see No. 27.

Imitator of DESIDERIO DA SETTIGNANO (b. c.1430, 
d. 1464)

27. Virgin and Child
66.5 cms. (height); 41 cms. (width)
Pietra serena (finegrained greygreen Fiesole sandstone). 
Unfinished. All the edges of the block of stone are chipped and 
irregular. The lower corner to proper right has broken off but has 
been reattached. `S. / 5. / ' is painted in black on this corner. 
The relief is set in a gilded wood frame of the `Salvator Rosa' type 

but with an arched top and foliate ornament in the spandrels.

Given by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. S. 5 in his catalogues. 
Bought `from Lombardi [Francesco Lombardi] in Florence in 
1859', for 17 gold Napoleons according to a receipt and certificate 
dated 16 February and signed by Lombardi which is stuck in the 
notebook catalogue. (It cost Â£14 10s. according to the separate 
`Memoranda of prices paid'.) Said by Lombardi to have come from 
the Palazzo BrunacciniCompagna, Florence (see below).
Fortnum considered this unfinished schiacciato relief to be 
one of the masterpieces in his collection. He found the 
`admirable folds of the drapery' and `noble expression of the 
heads' comparable even with the celebrated relief, also in 
pietra serena, of an ideal female profile bust then regarded as 
of St Cecilia. This latter relief, now in the Toledo Museum 
of Art, had also been sold by Francesco Lombardi, the 
distinguished Florentine jeweller, goldsmith, and art dealer 
to `an Englishman'. It was said to have come from the same 
source, Palazzo BrunacciniCompagna, and was attributed 
by Lombardi to the same artist, Donatello. The Englishman 
who had bought the St Cecilia was either Samuel Woodburn 
or someone acting for him. At Woodburn's sale on 15 May 
1854 it was bought by Mr Rickman `of Duke St.' for Lord 
Elcho (not, as recently asserted, by a Mr Hickman acting 
independently). Fortnum also related his relief to another 
one in pietra serena of the Virgin and Child acquired for the 
South Kensington (now the Victoria and Albert) Museum in 
1861 with the GigliCampana Collection (75821861). This 
was, with the St Cecilia, for the halfcentury between 1880 
and 1930, one of the most admired, reproduced, and imitated 
of all Renaissance sculptures.
Lombardi sold the relief to Fortnum with a certificate 
quoting the opinions of the eminent Florentine sculptors and 
academicians Emilio Santarelli and Vincenzo Consavi that it 
was by Donatello and came from the same source as the 
St Cecilia. Fortnum at first accepted this but he altered the 
entry in his notebook catalogue_he was now `inclined to 
attribute these works to Desiderio rather than Donatello' and 
with this view most subsequent scholars agreed after the 
exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1888. Not long after 
Fortnum's death, however, Bode, the world's leading 
authority on Italian sculpture, visited Oxford and expressd 
doubts about the relief. C. F. Bell noted in the margin of 
Fortnum's large catalogue Bode's opinion that it was a forgery, 
perhaps by the same hand as No. 26. (He also noted the 
opinion of the Donatello scholar P. Schubring that the material 

was not pietra serena but verde di Prato.) Bell kept the relief 
on display in the Fortnum Gallery and in his Summary Guide 
of 1931 described it as `school of Desiderio da Settignano' 
(p. 23). Doubts had also been expressed concerning the 
St Cecilia before 1910 but not by Bode who, however, did 
also believe that the Victoria and Albert Museum's relief was 
fake.
In a paper first published in Apollo in 1974 entitled `The 
Forging of Italian Renaissance Sculpture', J. PopeHennessy 
grouped the three reliefs which Fortnum had first associated 
and cited three others in the same material as also being by 
the same hand: a portrait of a lady in the Detroit Institute of 
Art, a Virgin and Child sold in Zurich in 1909 (Hommel 
Sale, 10-18 August, lot 1149) and a portrait of a lady in 
Berlin, concluding that `there can be no reasonable doubt 
that all of these six pietra serena reliefs belong together, were 
planned by a single mind, and date from the middle of the 
nineteenth century'. (The Study and Criticism of Italian 
Sculpture (Princeton, NJ, 1980), 235). He proposed that they 
were made by a Florentine sculptor, Odoardo Fantacchiotti 
(1809-77), for the dealer, jeweller, and goldsmith Francesco 
Lombardi (1787-1864).
This hypothesis has met with widespread acceptance. But 
it is not proven. Lombardi is described as `one of the principal 
instigators and one of the main vendors of forged sculptures' 
in Florence (ibid. 233), but no evidence is produced to 
support this claim. His tomb, erected by his heirs in S. Croce, 
incorporates what is now thought of as a very accomplished 
pastiche of a relief by Donatello, which Lombardi had given 
to the church in his lifetime. But, if it is a pastiche, might not 
Lombardi have been deceived by it? Surely genuine pride and 
piety, a desire to associate himself with a great work of 
Florentine devotional art and to gain credit for giving it to 
the public (for S. Croce is a museum of sorts), is more 
probable than PopeHennessy's proposal that he enjoyed the 
idea of continuing to fool connoisseurs after his death. As 
for Fantacchiotti, there is no very close relationship between 
the style of the pietra serena reliefs and the accomplished 
blend of neoclassicism with a quattrocento relief style found 
in his tondo of the Virgin and Child in the tomb of Raphael 
Morghen in S. Croce and in that on the Giuntini monument 
in S. Giuseppe, both completed in 1854, (illustrated by Pope
Hennessy, The Study and Criticism of Italian Sculpture, 230-
1, pls. 15 and 16). There is little sign in these reliefs of the 
distinctive mannerisms of those in Oxford and the Victoria 
and Albert Museum which derive from a study of Desiderio: 
the flattening of volumes (so that eyelids, fingers, limbs, and 
haloes seem to have been cut out of card or very thin dough), 
the rhyming of drapery folds and edges (so that, for example, 
the edge of the Virgin's sleeve in Oxford or one end of the 
openings in the cuff are aligned with folds in the drapery 
behind), the tremulous undulations of the Virgin's hair. 
Fantocchiotti had a genuine feeling for quattrocento art and 
was doubtless capable of mimicking it, but there were other 

sculptors of whom this was no less true_Ulisse Cambi, for 
instance, whose tomb in SS Annunziata for Marchese Luigi 
TempiMalzimedici, dated 1849, includes angels imitated 
from Luca della Robbia and a floral border imitated from 
Ghiberti, or the Venetian Vincenzo Favenza, who between 
1849 and 1853 carved the boxwood dining room doors for 
Kingston Lacy in Dorset, imitating works by Donatello, Luca 
della Robbia, and Jacopo Sansovino, as well as the antique, 
as prescribed by his patron the connoisseur William Bankes 
(1786-1855).
Little is known of Fantacchiotti's career and few works are 
attributed to the last years of his life, but this is true of many 
artists. There is nothing strange in reference books only listing 
early works by which artists first established a reputation. In 
fact Fantacchiotti was at work on the ambitious and acclaimed 
Susanna (signed 1872, Museo d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo 
Pitti, Florence) in his later years and not merely engaged on 
minor monuments. And even if diminished productivity in 
the second half of his career were established there are 
numerous explanations for this other than the clandestine 
activity as a forger implied by PopeHennessy's observation 
that `There is no telling what he was up to during the crucial 
years when foreign collectors and museums were engaged in 
the block buying of Italian sculptures', (ibid. 230-1). 
Elsewhere in his paper PopeHennessy discusses the case of 
Giovanni Bastianini, who was exposed as a forger in 1867, 
and remarks that as well as being trained at the Florentine 
Academy under Pio Fedi he `may also have worked under 
Fantacchiotti; in any case the two sculptors must have known 
each other well' (ibid. 237). He `may' have worked under 
Fantacchiotti, but there is no reason to suppose that he did: 
he would probably have `known' Fantacchiotti, but there is 
no reason to suppose that they were friends or associates.
The possibility that all three pietra serena reliefs grouped 
by Fortnum, the Toledo St Cecilia, the Victoria and Albert 
Museum's Virgin and Child and the Ashmolean Museum's 
unfinished Virgin and Child, are Renaissance works should 
be reconsidered. When compared with the works of Desiderio 
da Settignano, such as the reliefs in the Bargello and in the 
Galleria Reale in Turin or the exquisite fragment of a pietra 
serena relief of the Virgin and Child in the MusÃ©e at Lyons 
(I. Cardellini, Desiderio da Settignano (Milan, 1962), 121-2, 
136-8, Fig. 323), which inspired them, it is impossible to 
believe that the Victoria and Albert and the Ashmolean reliefs 
are by Desiderio (I have not studied the St Cecilia). But 
Desiderio was imitiated in the fifteenth century as well as in 
the nineteenth.
It is true that to most expert eyes today both the Virgin 
and Child reliefs have a modern `look' but this is due to the 
great influence which the Victoria and Albert Museum relief 
enjoyed in the early decades of this century_a striking 
example of which is the marble head of the Virgin of
1922-3 by the young Henry Moore. No one could claim 
that the styles of the 1850s betray themselves in these works.


Workshop of Giovanni Franchi and Sons (active 1860s)

After a follower of DONATELLO
28. Entombment of Christ
23.9 cms. (height); 45.3 cms. (length)
Copper (electrotype) with some gilding. The relief is loosely 
mounted in a flat ebonized wooden frame with a gilded chamfer at 
the sight edge. `B / 703 / ' is painted in white on the back of the 
copper. The frame has an old paper label marked `B 675 '.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed in 
1899. B. 675 in his large catalogue, B. 703 in his notebook 
catalogue.
Fortnum described this as an
Electrodeposit by Franchi from the work by Donatello in the 
Museum, Lambras, at Vienna [the Schloss Ambras Collection then 
on display in the Lower Belvedere]. Some portions of the original 
work are picked out with gold as the shield and fibula of the soldier 
, 
the sarcophagus &c. this has been reproduced in the deposit. Many 
years ago, I noticed this fine and highly elaborated work in a dark 
corner of the Ambras Museum and was most courteously permitted 
to have a cast taken from it, which was subsequently photographed 
at Venice [perhaps an error for Vienna], and from which the deposit 
was taken by Mr Franchi for the S.K.M. [South Kensington 
Museum]. It is engraved in Perkins Italian Sculptures. Suppt. p. 274. 

This relief which has, since 1891, been in the Kunsthistorisches 
Museum, Vienna (inv. 6059), is no longer regarded as a 
`noble work in Donato's most forcible manner', as Fortnum 
proposed, but as the work of a follower, perhaps indebted to 
Mantegna as well as to Donatello. It is surely by the same 
artist as the no less mysterious bronze, gold, and silver mirror, 
the socalled Martelli Mirror, in the Victoria and Albert 
Museum (87171863) where one finds the same minute 
attention to folds and creases of drapery and skin and the 
same frozen expressions_a point not made in the admirable 
entry on the relief by M. LeitheJasper in Renaissance Master 
Bronzes from the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (National 
Gallery of Art, Washington (and elsewhere), 1986), 61-4, 
no. 4.
According to LeitheJasper the attribution to Donatello 
goes back to E. von Sacken's Kunstwerke und Gera~8the des 
Mittelalters und der Renaissance in der Kais. KÃ¶n. Ambreser 
Sammlung in Originalphotographien (undated but Vienna, 
1865). Fortnum, however, was not inclined to exaggerate his 
own discoveries; had the work been published when it was 
`noticed' by him he would certainly have been told as much 
(since he must have had dealings with the curatorial staff in 
order to have a cast taken from it) and he was invariably 
scrupulous in recording such references. It is likely therefore 
that von Sacken took the attribution from Fortnum. His cast 
was made in the winter of 1865 and 1866 when Franchi was 
in Florence and Pisa making casts for the South Kensington 

Museum and Fortnum had a plaster of it made for 
presentation to that institution_the business is described in 
Fortnum's letter to Henry Cole of 10 January 1866 in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum. That Franchi was active in the 
making of electrotypes is clear from Fortnum's comment in 
his Bronzes of 1877, that `electro deposit as carried out by 
Messrs Elkington and the late Signor Franchi' had been a 
`singular success'. An idea of Franchi's talents as an original 
craftsman may be obtained from the casket he cast and chased 
to contain the memorandum of the Great Exhibition in 1871 
(Victoria and Albert Museum 3191872). His family firm 
were to become the principle rivals of Brucciani (see Nos. 450, 
580, 581) as suppliers of academic plaster casts.
In 1867 Fortnum acquired in Florence a fine plaquette of 
the Deposition (B. 615 in his catalogue) which he believed to 
be `by Riccio or the master himself ' (i.e. Donatello), which 
is now regarded as by Riccio but inspired by Donatello's 
relief (in stone, but thought by Fortnum to be in terracotta) 
made 1446-50 for the altar of the Santo in Padua which 
must also be the startingpoint of the relief in Vienna.



After Francesco (Fran}ois) DUQUESNOY (`Il Fiammingo') 
(1597-1643)
29. Sleeping child
13.7 cms. (length); 7 cms. (height)
Bronze with a brown patina with traces of black varnish and some 
verdigris. Hollowcast. Open below.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed in 
1899. Bought in Bologna in 1883 for 3 guineas. B. 450 in his large 
catalogue.
The figure is derived, as Fortnum supposed, from the models 
of sleeping putti attributed to Duquesnoy which already 
existed in large numbers in bronze and ivory by the end of 
the seventeenth century, not only in Italy but in France and 
the Low Countries. Neither in the modelling nor in the 
finishing is this example a work of a quality that would 
normally have attracted Fortnum.


After Francesco (Fran}ois) DUQUESNOY (`Il Fiammingo') 
(1597-1643)
30 and 31. Pair of plaquettes 
decorated with revelling children
9.15 cms. (diameter of both plaquettes)
Copper, firegilt. The gilding has worn off in a few salient parts. 
The metal is very thin and has been modelled in repoussÃ©. Most of 
the detail has been chased (as distinct from chiselled). There are 
some small traces of verdigris in the front of one, and in the back 
of both, plaquettes. There are small perforations around the head 
of the goat, by the chin of the boy being dragged by the goat, and 
by the cheek of the boy dragging it in one case (30), and between 
the legs of the child pretending to be a ghost and by the recumbent 

child's right shoulder and right armpit in the other (31). The 
plaquette with the goat (30) is endorsed in white paint 
`B. / 684 / ', the one with the `ghost' (31) with `B. / 685 / '.
Lent to the Museum by C. D. E. Fortnum on 14 September 1888 
and given latter in the same year. B. 684 and B. 685 in his catalogue 
s. 
No provenance is given in either catalogue, but they were presumably 

acquired after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which they 
are not included, was compiled.
The relief of the revelling children with a goat derives from a 
composition invented by Duquesnoy. Bellori relates how this 
sculptor made a relief of divine love fighting profane love, and 
another relief, the same size, of a bacchanal of putti dragging 
by the horns and beating a goat and including one boy 
frightening some others with a mask. The wax model was 
copied in porphyry by Tomaso Fedele of Rome, `Tomaso del 
porfido', who was celebrated for fashioning this notably hard 
material with precision and softness. Bellori notes that the 
mezzorilievo by Tomaso after Duquesnoy was given by 
Cardinal Francesco Barberini to King Philip IV of Spain. In 
fact the relief by Tomaso is after the first of these 
compositions, the Sacred and Profane Love, payments for 
which were made in 1631. A marble relief of the bacchanal 
in the Doria Pamphili Collection has been dated to about 
1626 (C. Noehles, `F. Duquesnoy: Un busto ignoto e la 
cronologia delle sue opere', Arte antica e moderna (1964), 
90, 93-4, n. 25; for Bellori see G. P. Bellori, Le vite de' 
pittori, scultori e architetti moderni, ed. E. Borea (Turin, 
1976), 289-90). A notable seventeenthcentury version of the 
goat composition is the one in black marble in the Villa 
Borghese (no. 508, reproduced in M. Fransolet, `Fran}ois du 
Quesnoy', MÃ©moires de l'AcadÃ©mie Royale de Belgique, 2nd 
series 9 (1942)). But if the composition originated in this 
complex scene of twelve actors it was soon reduced to eight, 
as in the ivory in the Victoria and Albert Museum (no. 1061, 
companion with no. 1064, a group of the putti around a goat 
which is milked by a satyr), to six, as here, or to four, as in 
the fictive frieze below the portrait of a man with a view of 
St Peter's by Hendrik Frans Van Lint (Copper, Slate and 
Marble (Hazlitt Gooden and Fox, Oct. 1967), no. 30). The 
composition of the children playing at ghosts (or blind man's 
buff, as Fortnum supposed) was much repeated in the 
eighteenth century but is of uncertain origin: it might be 
considered as a development of the theme initiated by 
Duquesnoy with his putto holding a mask (itself a 
development of an idea found on antique cameos).
Gilt bronze or copper plaquettes of this type are sometimes 
found applied to luxury furniture in the eighteenth century. 
Such might well have been the purpose for which these 
examples were made. There is a pair of plaquettes of dancing 
and fighting putti of similar size in the Hermitage (M. Lopato, 
Western European Plaquettes . . . the Hermitage Collection 
(Leningrad, 1976), 63, no. 165, inv. 17551). The pretty 

landscape setting in the Ashmolean's reliefs also suggests an 
eighteenthcentury date, but does not exclude a late 
seventeenthcentury one. Fortnum described the plaquettes 
as `carefully executed from designs by Clodion' in his 
notebook catalogue but changed this to `the style of Clodion' 
in his large catalogue.



Pio FEDI (1816-92)
32. Pia de' Tolomei and Nello della 
Pietra (also known as Il sospetto)
90.2 cms. (height including integral plinth); 4 cms. (height of 
plinth); 35.2 cms. (diameter of plinth)
Carrara marble. `PIO FEDI SCULTORE FIORENTINO' is chiselled behind 
the figures on the upper surface of the octagonal plinth with `FECE 
NEL 1872' in smaller capitals on a separate line. On the front of the 

same plinth and also on the upper surface is chiselled in decorated 
letters `RICORDITI ~^@ DI ~^@ ME' to left of his left shoe, `CHE ~^@ 
SON ~^@ LA ~^@ PIA' 
to right, the capital `R' and `P' being larger and more decorated, 
and also on another line `DANTE', to left of the shoe and `PUR. c. 
V' to right. There are numerous chips and losses to the lower 
moulding and the hollow of the octagonal base especially beside the 
left foot of Nello. Projecting drapery at the back of the group has 
also been broken. The pommel of his sword hilt and the end of the 
scabbard are missing. There are holes, regular in shape and 
penetrating carved areas in a manner which makes it seem unlikely 
that they are flaws in the marble, possibly caused by a pointing 
machine_large ones are on the back on his tunic and on the back 
of her right arm, smaller ones on her right breast and shoulder and 
in the back of her dress.
When acquired, the marble was covered in a dirty yellow film with 
some black encrustation in the less conspicuous parts of the drapery 

and a few (test?) patches of clean and polished white marble. The 
sculpture had been filthy (but not apparently from exposure outside, 

since there was no evidence of frost damage) and cleaning had been 
attempted with an acidic solution, the surface thereby losing its 
original textures. Cleaning was continued in the conservation 
laboratories of the Ashmolean Museum's Department of 
Antiquities, by Kathleen Kimber under the direction of Mark 
Norman, with distilled water steam and some acetone. The holes, 
already mentioned, were filled and the surface was then slightly 
waxed.
Purchased for Â£2,676 (hammer price Â£2,400) at Sotheby's, London, 
10 June 1988, lot 140, from the France Fund, with a contribution 
of Â£1,320 from the Museums and Galleries Commission's Regional 
Fund administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum. The group 
arrived in the Museum on 28 June, but was in the conservation 
studio throughout 1988 and 1989. Put on display in the Combe 
Room in December 1989.

The group illustrates the final lines (130-6) of the fifth 
Canto of Dante's Purgatorio (one of which is chiselled on the 
plinth):

sequito il terzo spirito al secondo, 
`Deh, quando tu sarai tornato al mondo,
e riposato della lunga via,'
sequito~6 il terzo spirito al secondo,

`ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
Siena mi fe', disfecemi Maremma:
salsi colui che innanellata, pria

disposando, m'avea con la sua gemma.'

Which may be translated:

`Pray, when the living world you have regained, 
The third spirit upon the second followed:
`Pray, when the living world you have regained,
And taken rest from this long road,
Remember me who was La Pia named.
Born in Siena: undone in the marshy land
Of Maremma. How is known to him who claimed
Me with a ring; who held me in his hand.'
Nineteenthcentury commentators on Dante believed La Pia 
to be a lady of the Sienese family of Tolomei who married 
Nello d'Ighiramo, captain of the Tuscan Guelphs, and was 
put to death by him in 1295 at Castello della Pietra, in the 
Sienese Maremma, out of jealousy (unfounded, according to 
some). The manner of her death was said to have been 
confinement in a place where marsh air was fatal. Banchi in 
his commentary of 1886 proved that this identification was 
impossible. The subject was also treated by Domenico 
Trentanove in an imaginary bust portrait dated 1886 (Museo 
d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Pitti, Florence) and by Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti in a finished drawing in a private collection 
and in a painting in the Spencer Art Gallery of the University 
of Kansas at Lawrence (1868). Whereas Rossetti showed the 
lady languishing in the Maremma, Pio Fedi represents her 
with her husband. The moment may be that at which 
suspicion steals into the husband's mind to the dismay of his 
innocent wife, or that at which intimations of his plans dawn 
upon her. Theodosia Trollope had no doubts:
The group represents the illfated lady, at the moment when her 
husband prepared to leave her all alone in the dreary old tower of 
the Maremma, which is yet pointed out as the scene of her piteous 
ending. Laying one arm around his shoulder, she bends forward 
and looks into his averted face with anxious forboding, as though 
enquiring how soon he will return. He meanwhile gazes gloomily 
at the ground, wrapping himself in the blackness of his evil thought, 

and shrinking from the pleading eyes of his victim. He seems rather 
to be waiting for the sound of his horse's hoofs on the stones 

without, and chafing at its delay, than listening to her timid words 

of inquiry. (`Notes on the Most Recent Productions of Florentine 
Sculptors', Part III, Art Journal (1 July 1861), 210-11)
This group may come as a surprise to those whose 
acquaintance with Pio Fedi's sculpture has been confined to 
the more conspicuous public monuments by him in 
Florence_the once famous Rape of Polyxena (executed 
1860-5 from an earlier plaster) which was erected by public 
subscription in the Loggia dei Lanzi, the statues of the 
sculptor Nicola Pisano and of the botanist and anatomist 
Andrea Cesalpino in the series of great Florentines filling the 
niches of the Uffizi (both commissioned in 1846), the 
monument to General Manfredo Fanti of 1872 in Piazza San 
Marco, or the Liberty on the monument to Niccolini of 1883 
in Santa Croce. In its shallow relief and its costume accessories 
it reminds us of Fedi's training as a goldsmith and engraver. 
An interest in quattrocento sculpture found in the exquisite 
low relief of this group can also be seen in the figures on the 
base of the Fanti monument and he in fact created a number 
of sculptures of historical subjects involving virtuoso marble 
carving_for instance his Beatrice Cenci at her Trial or his 
infant Christopher Columbus seated halfnude on the shore 
among the sea shells earnestly launching a model boat (a 
group dated 1886)_and he was also interested in sweetly 
ornamental gallery sculpture which represented mental 
disturbance, intriguing because inaccessible to us_as in his 
Secret, a group of a mother earnestly listening to a confidence 
whispered by her son, or his Chrysalis in which a young nude 
girl contemplates with perplexity a cocoon from which a 
butterfly is emerging, an emblem of her own puberty. Versions 
of these sculptures were numbers 89, 91, 224, and 225 in 
Fedi's atelier sale in Florence on 28, 30 April and 1 May 1894 
(catalogue in French, sale `sous la direction de Mr G. 
Sangiorgi'), where a version of this group 108 cms. high 
signed `Pio Fedi scolp~@~6' featured as no. 223 (illustrated) 
together with a twisted column pedestal of verde di Prato 
103 cms. high. In addition there were two plaster casts (lots 
97 and 194) and the first maquettes, also in plaster (lots 35 
and 43), of the group.
The group of La Pia and Nello was originally made as a 
model in 1846 and commissioned as a fullsize marble, to 
match DuprÃ©'s Dante and Beatrice, by the Grand Duke 
Leopold II in the same year (the contract was dated 
17 November). Final payment was made on 31 May 1848 and 
at the end of that year or early in 1849 a repetition was 
commissioned. One of these two versions was placed in the 
grand ducal gardens at Poggio Imperiale. Neither has been 
traced. (Cultura neoclassica e romantica nella Toscana 
granducale (Palazzo Pitti, Florence, 1972), 75-6, no. 12, entry 
by Sandra Pinto.) Leopold II took special interest in the 
Maremma as a subject (the marshes were then being drained) 
and he also commissioned from Enrico Pallastrini (1817-76) 
a painting of Nello at the tomb of La Pia. He also took a 

special interest in Pio Fedi, paying for him to study in Rome 
earlier in the 1840s. The group remained immensely popular 
and Fedi made a number of replicas on a reduced scale. The 
earliest of these would seem to be that dated 1861, and 
exhibited in that year at the Esposizione Italiana di Firenze, 
which is now in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Pitti 
(Cultura neoclassica . . ., op. cit.). All the later versions seem 
to have been bought by British visitors to Florence for whom 
the exquisite textures, miniature detail, medieval dress, and 
psychological drama were already familiar from the paintings 
of the PreRaphaelites. It is in fact tempting to propose that 
the lost original version of Fedi's group was an influence on 
Holman Hunt's Claudio and Isabella (completed 1850) and 
Munro's Paolo and Francesca (completed in plaster by 1851). 
Mrs Trollope when she visited Fedi's studio in Via Chiara 
(near that of Hiram Powers) noted that the group was `being 
twice repeated on commission for London, the one for Mr 
Overend, the other for Mr N. Clayton' (op. cit.). She noted 
that there are not wanting distinguished art judges who rank 
this `poetical little group' on a level with `Signor Fedi's 
colossal Pyrrhus and Polyxena'.
The versions she mentions are likely to be identical with 
two sold in London in recent years_at Sotheby's, 6-7 
November 1986, lot 307 bearing the inscription `Pio Fedi 
Statuario di Firenze Sculpi 1862', and at Sotheby's, 18-
21 March 1988, Lot 120 signed `Sculptor. P. Fedi. Fioro', 
without a date. This latter version (purchased by Anthony 
Roth, then of Maddox Street), which is in exceptionally good 
condition, has a narrower original plinth than the others 
(diameter 27 cms.) and also a separate octagonal base. It is 
also considerably smaller (67.6 cms. high including the 2 cms. 
high plinth). In these versions and the Ashmolean's the 
detailing is different: for instance, the rope by which her purse 
is suspended and the tassels hanging from it, the ornament 
on his sword belt, the patterns of the brocade. Careful 
variations such as this are impossible in routine studio 
reproductions, and the date of 1872 on the Ashmolean's 
version, not being the date of the first reduced version, is 
surely a further indication of its status as a special replica by 
Fedi himself the creation of which he felt to be worth 
documenting. It is noteworthy that in the Ashmolean version 
some symbolism is probably intended in the patterns of the 
brocade: there are dragons on his sleeves and putti play with 
birds in the panels of her dress. Similar versions and variants 
are recorded of Fedi's La Fiorentina, dated 1874, in the 
Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, which seems to be the only 
other recorded statue by him in a public collection in Britain 
(see Walker Art Gallery: Foreign Catalogue (Liverpool, 1977), 
no. 4226, pp. 298-9).
Mrs Trollope noted that Fedi had tried to repeat the success 
of this group with another of Ippolito Buondelmonte with 
Dianora de' Bardi which was in course of execution in 1861.

33. Bacchus and Ariadne
30.5 cms. (height); 23.3 cms. (length, from panther head beside 
thigh of Bacchus to the vase beside Ariadne); 22.7 cms. (length 
of integral base); 14.9 cms. (width of integral base)
Earthenware of a pinky cream colour (warmer in tone than its 
companion No. 34). The glaze is very slightly green where gathered, 
very slightly crazed in places, and worn and chipped in a few small 
areas. The left foot of Bacchus is broken off and the toes lost, two 

fingers of the left hand of Ariadne are broken off and lost, the left 

arm of Bacchus is broken at the shoulder and repaired with ugly 
discoloured adhesive apparent in the join and chipped edges to it, 
and a large chip is missing from the base, front proper right (this 
is the only recent damage). The group was cast in four parts: the 
base (which is hollow below); the two figures (hollow only in the 
thickest parts); and the urn (apparently hollow), all of which would 

have been assembled before firing. The leaves and grapes were also 
evidently separately modelled and dropped into place at this stage_
many of these are chipped or have fallen off, which might be early 
damage.
Purchased from David Pickup Ltd. of 15 High Street, Burford, 
together with No. 34 for Â£1,250 on 5 March 1989 with a 
contribution of Â£625 from the Regional Fund administered by the 
Victoria and Albert Museum, the remainder coming from the 
Reginald Jones Bequest Fund. The groups were seen by Gerald 
Taylor in Late January 1989 and taken to the Museum on 
30 January. Purchased by Mr Pickup at the sale of Hill Court, 
Herefordshire, in 1986.
This group, representing Bacchus introducing Ariadne to 
viticulture, seems to have been designed by Foggini as a 
bronze. Several casts are known in this medium: one is in the 
National Gallery of Art, Washington (exhibited The Twilight 
of the Medici (Gli ultimi Medici) (Detroit and Florence, 
1974), no. 297); another is in the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
Malibu (83.SB.333); another is in the MusÃ©e Nissim de 
Camondo, Paris (no. 110); another in the MusÃ©e Jacquemart
AndrÃ©, Paris (n. 251_formerly Bardini Collection); and 
others are in private collections (see catalogue entry by
J. Montagu in the catalogue of the exhibition just cited, in
the unpaginated addenda). Most of these bronze groups are 
paired (or are known to have once been paired) with a group 
of Venus and Cupid also by Foggini.
The group was evidently also made in terracotta, and 
subsequently in porcelain by the Doccia factory, for a late 
eighteenthcentury inventory of models includes a `Gruppo 
di Arianna e Bacco. La detta Arianna in alto di premere l'uva 
in un vaso, di terra cotta con forma. Del Foggini.' The piece
mould survives in the factory's museum (K. Lankheit, Die 
Modellsammlung der Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 
1982), 127, pl. 123). The porcelain version (as reconstructed 
from the surviving moulds) differed in no essential respects 

from the bronze except that the grapes are held less high by 
Bacchus and connect with the grapes in his hair which thus 
supplies an additional support. The Ashmolean's earthenware 
must be derived from a porcelain version. Much detail has 
been lost. There is no longer any pattern on the girdle passing 
between Ariadne's breasts and she no longer wears a bracelet. 
The vase beside her has no handle and she is given no grapes 
to squeeze into it. There is no vine branch on the ground 
between her and Bacchus. Her face is also turned slightly up. 
The modelling is also generally much cruder. For the factories 
where it could have been made see No. 34.

Unknown Italian foundry

After Giovanni Battista FOGGINI (1652-1725)
34. Hercules and Iole
31.15 cms. (height); 26.7 cms. (length, from Iole's right arm's 
stump to the right hand of Hercules); 22.7 cms. (length of 
integral base); 15.1 cms. (width of integral base)
Earthenware of a pinky cream colour. The glaze is slightly green 
where gathered, crazed in a few areas (e.g. on the left knee of 
Hercules), and either worn or chipped off in numerous areas (e.g. 
on the right thigh of Hercules). The left foot of Hercules has been 
broken and repaired, three of the fingers of his left hand have been 

broken and are lost, his nose and upper lip have been broken off 
and are lost, the thumb of Iole's left hand has been broken off and 
is lost, her right arm has been broken at the wrist, and the hand is 

lost. There is a large chip missing from the base, back proper left 
(this is the only recent damage). There is a hole in the base beside 

the right foot of Hercules to secure his club held by Iole (now 
missing). The group was cast in four parts; the base (which is hollow 

below); the two figures (hollow only in the thickest parts); and the 

club (presumably solid), all of which would have been assembled 
before firing.
See No. 33 for provenance.
This group representing Hercules infatuated with Iole, having 
surrendered his club and lion skin to her and taking up her 
distaff (as described by Boccaccio and Tasso, adapting the 
ancient tale of Hercules and Omphale), seems to have been 
designed by Foggini as a bronze and several casts are known 
in this medium: some were exhibited by his sons; one was 
catalogued as his work in Du~8sseldorf in 1751; examples are 
known in several private collections; and one is in the Victoria 
and Albert Museum (A. 91956)_for these see the entry for 
the latter version by J. Montagu in the catalogue of the 
exhibition The Twilight of the Medici (Gli ultimi Medici) 
(Detroit and Florence, 1974), 60-1, no. 24. There is also a 
terracotta version in the Birmingham City Museum and Art 
Gallery, in which the right leg of Iole is not crossed behind 

that of Hercules, which might be a variant on the composition 
by Foggini, but is more probably by a follower.
A wax model was recorded in a late eighteenthcentury 
inventory of the Doccia factory `Gruppo d'Ercole e Jole. Del 
Foggini in cera con forma'_and the piecemould survives in 
the factory's museum (K. Lankheit, Die Modellsammlung der 
Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 1982), 122). It was 
no doubt a version in porcelain which served as the model 
for this and other versions in earthenware. These differ from 
the bronze in that here the arm of Hercules is placed on his 
hip rather than being raised. The lion skin in the earthenware 
version also falls over Iole's shoulder, the drapery folds 
between the legs of Hercules are less deeply undercut, and 
there is no plant on the rockwork base.
A version of this group is illustrated by Giuseppe Morazzoni 
in his La terraglia italiana (Milan, n.d. [?1956], pl. 119), 
paired, as this is, with one of Bacchus and Ariadne, both in 
the collection of Cav. Eugenio Imbert in Milan (perhaps the 
pair today displayed in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan). Another 
version of the Bacchus and Ariadne in the same collection 
and also illustrated (pl. 116) seems to have been a companion 
with a Pan and Syrinx after the famous antique group (see 
F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London 
and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 286-8). Both the Hercules 
and Iole and two Bacchus and Ariadne groups illustrated in 
Morazzoni are certainly from the same factory as the 
Ashmolean's groups. This is identified by Morazzoni as the 
Manifattura Aldrovrandi in Bologna and the models are even 
attributed to Giacomo Rossi who is known to have managed 
the factory. No reasons are given, but tradition (which is 
presumably the basis for the attribution) must be treated with 
respect.
Count Filippo AldrovandiMarescotti opened the factory 
in 1794 in his palace in Contrada Galliera, Bologna: it was in 
full operation by 1798. The aim was to compete with English 
creamware which was being so successfully exported to Italy 
and the body consisted of `terra di Vicenza bianchissima' 
together with pure white marble dust from Carrara and the 
glaze was made with `litargirio d'Inghilterra', Italian flint, and 
sea salt (Morazzoni, op. cit. 109-15). The earthenware body 
of these groups is pale but is less fine than creamware.
There are many other factories in Italy at which these figures 
might have been produced_the Este factory from 1779 under 
the ownership of Girolamo Franchini (1728-1808) has been 
regarded as a likely place of origin_so too has the Ferniani 
factory at Faenza. A version of the group of Hercules and Iole 
was certainly made at Faenza but in a more careful model 
with numerous variations (the right leg of Hercules is drawn 
in, his left arm raised_as in the bronzes_Iole's head is 
differently inclined, a lion's paw is tied across her breasts) and 
as a companion group with an entirely different interpretation 
of Bacchus and Ariadne. (The examples of these groups in 
the Villa Case Grandi in Faenza come from the factory's own 
collection_see the catalogue of the exhibition L'eta~6 

neoclassica a Faenza (Palazzo Milzetti, Faenza, 1979), 242, 
nos. 533-4, pl. 398.) On the other hand examples of the 
Ashmolean groups also survive in Faenza's Museo 
Internazionale delle Ceramiche (inv. nos. 9859 and 9860_
ibid. 243, nos. 538-9, unillustrated). Several large groups, 
one of a couple at an altar, another of Pan making unwelcome 
advances to a girl, and a third of Cupid and Psyche included 
in the Cini gift displayed (without labels) in Palazzo dei 
Conservatori in Rome are very similar in modelling and colour 
and character of glaze to the Ashmolean groups and must be 
from the same factory.


Unknown founder

Perhaps after Giovanni Battista FOGGINI (1652-1725)
35. Group of furniture mounts: 
four scroll feet, four tendril volutes, 
and five plants
8.3 cms. (height of each foot); 16 cms. (length of each foot); 
35.5 cms. (length of each tendril); 4.4 cms. (height of the largest, 

central plant); 19.8 cms. (length of the largest, central plant)
Bronze, firegilt. Each ornament is solid cast. All are partially tex 
tured 
with a punch. Two of the plants retain handwrought irregular
headed gilded nails.
The mounts are attached to the `Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet'. 
Purchased for the Heberden Coin Room from `The Highly 
Important Collection of Roman Brass Coins and Medallions 
originally formed in the mideighteenth century' and sold by order 
of `The Earl Fitzwilliam's Wentworth Estates Company' by Christie's 
at Spencer House 30 and 31 May 1949 in which it was the final 
lot, 501. According to tradition in the Coin Room the cabinet was 
purchased by the Keeper without previous plans, but copies of the 
catalogue mark it down to `Spink' for Â£50. Whether the Keeper 
asked Spink's to bid shortly before the lot was auctioned, or bought 

it immediately afterwards from Spink's, is not clear. The cabinet of 

ebony with pietra dura pictures, friezes, and columns is presumed 
to have been acquired by the 2nd marquis of Rockingham (1730-
82) when he was still Lord Malton, perhaps when in Florence on 
the Grand Tour between his arrival there in early January 1748/9 
and his departure for Siena in May 1749, or upon his return there 
around 1 September 1749, but cabinets of this type, a speciality of 
the grand ducal workshops in Florence, had been popular with 
British visitors to Italy for over a century.
The cabinet was not originally designed for coins and the 
substructure in ebonized wood decorated with ivory 
medallions (see Nos. 159-61) must have been added in the 
third quarter of the eighteenth century when it was converted 
for this purpose. The ormolu Venus on top (see No. 40) is 
also an addition but of what date is less certain. The cabinet 

if purchased by Rockingham may not have been acquired with 
conversion in mind. Although his passion for collecting coins 
was well established by 26 April 1750 when he wrote to his 
father from Rome that he had not been able to resist the 
`temptation' of purchasing `medalls', he is unlikely to have 
been bothered by storage problems at that moment. He 
continued to collect avidly long after he returned, boasting in 
1774 that his `collection of Great Brass is indeed 
acknowledged to be the finest in Europe in regard to the 
great number of rare heads and reverses, and also in regard 
to the high preservation they are in. I keep constantly upon 
the watch to pick up what I can in England, and having now 
been a collector for near 28 years and having always found 
great pleasure in the pursuit, I shall constantly continue it' 
(R. J. Hopper, `The Second Marquis of Rockingham, Coin 
Collector', Antiquaries Journal, 62/2 (1982), 322).
This was not the only example of Florentine pietra dura 
work, nor the only elaborate cabinet, in Rockingham's 
possession. A `curious cabinet' of tortoiseshell, ivory, and 
ebony is the work of art which receives most attention in the 
`Description of Wentworth House' published in the Universal 
Magazine for October 1770 (169-70). In the inventory of 
`Household Goods, Plate, Pictures' etc. made after 
Rockingham's death we find two entries which might 
correspond with the Ashmolean's cabinet: a `Cabinet 
Curiously inlaid with different kinds of Stones and 
Ornamented with Glass Columns & containing 10 Drawers, 
upon a black frame' in the Green Drawing Room at 
Wentworth Woodhouse (p. 13r, this part of the inventory 
dated 16 September 1782) and a `Black Ebony Cabinet 
Beautifully inlaid with Marbles etc.' in a ground floor room 
of the family's house in Grosvenor Square, London (p. 51v, 
this part dated 28 August 1782). An `Italian casket with 
domed lifting top exterior decorated in pietra dure [sic] 
mosaic with sprays of fruit held by ribands on black marble 
and ebonised ground with ormolu corner mounts and 
borders chased with masks and foliage' was lot 27 in the sale 
at Christie's, London, on 15 July 1948 of `Etruscan and 
Greek Vases and Fine English Furniture' from Wentworth 
Woodhouse. An `Important Early 18th Century Italian 
Ebony Cabinet and stand . . . elaborately inlaid in lapis lazuli 
scaglia [sic] and coloured marbles with exotic birds and sprays 
of flowers and fruit' was lot 293 in the sale of a `large portion 
of the contents of Wentworth Woodhouse' conducted at the 
house, 4-9 July 1949, by H. Spencer and Sons of Retford, 
Worksop, and Sheffield.
Some of the ormolu mounts on the coin cabinet_the four 
scroll and shell feet, the four tendril volutes, and the five 
loosely arranged plants on the cornice_are likely to be 
original, although it is hard to be sure since they have all been 
refixed. There are also some very inferior ornaments in mastic 
and wood such as the leaves above the keyhole escutcheon, 
and the drop below it. The keyhole escutcheon itself, which 
is the most remarkable of the ormolu mounts, is catalogued 

separately (No. 63). It may always have been fitted to this 
cabinet but it looks as if it might originally have been designed 
for another, earlier piece. The scrolled feet are very close in 
character to those on an ebony and pietra dura casket in a 
private collection which have been attributed to Foggini and, 
if enlarged, would be similar to those on the celebrated ebony 
and pietra dura priedieu in Palazzo Pitti which was made by 
A. Suster, G. A. Torricelli, and P. Molti to Foggini's designs 
in 1706 (A. Gonza~5lezPalacios, Il tempio del gusto (La Toscana 
e l'Italia settentrionale), 2 vols. (Milan, 1986), i. 43-4, 51, 
ii, pls. 88 and 135). The bronze tendrils are very similar to 
those projected in about 1705 for the urn of S. Maria 
Maddalena de' Pazzi in a drawing made by Foggini now in 
the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and they may also be 
related to some of the ornaments on a sumptuous pietra dura 
table presented to the king of Denmark in 1709, now in 
Rosenberg Castle, Copenhagen (ibid. i, pl. xii, ii, pl. 124). 
Whereas it could be argued that the feet are merely in the 
style of the late seventeenth century in Italy, tendrils of this 
sort seem to be an original invention of Foggini's.



Antonio GAI (1686-1769)
36. Angel supporting a horn
shaped candleholder
52.8 cms. (height including base); 2.1 cms. (height of base); 
13.5 cms. (diameter of base)
Bronze with oil gilding, extensively worn to reveal a slightly olive 

tan coloured natural patina. There is evidence of extensive chisellin 
g. 
The figure is hollow, and presumably a lostwax cast. The wings are 
solid cast and riveted to the back_solder now reinforces a join which 

must originally have been neater. The chiselling of the feathers pass 
es 
over the join. The upper portion of the horn has been cast separately 

and soldered. There is a hole between the wings in the figure's back. 

`AO GAI 1749' is chiselled with angular strokes on the side of the 
integral base behind the figure at proper left: the cross bar of the 

`A' is in the form of a `v' and the top of the `9' is squared. This i 
s 
preceded by a diagrammatic chalice, also chiselled.
Purchased in late January 1960 from Herbert N. Bier of 2 Strathearn 
Place, Hyde Park Square, London W2, for Â£900, from the France 
Fund with the assistance of a grant from the National ArtCollections 

Fund. Registered 15 December 1960. `In recent times' it had 
belonged to `an American Collector'.
The angel must have been companion to another in a 

complementary pose, as Parker noted when publishing the 
bronze in the Annual Report for 1960 (p. 65); indeed it 
probably belonged originally to a set of four, not least because 
it is very similar in character to the four standing angels (over 
4 ft high) also with hornshaped candleholders which Tiziano 
Aspetti was commissioned to make in the autumn of 1593 by 
the Congregazione dell'Arca for the altar of St Anthony, in 
S. Antonio, Padua (see A. Sartori, Documenti per la storia 
dell'arte a Padova (Vicenza, 1976), 11-12). Gai may well have 
been asked to take these famous angels as his models: if so he 
was not averse to imitating details as well as the general 
appearance of Aspetti's work: the belts and drapery borders 
of Aspetti's angels, and of the four Virtues he created for the 
altar rail of the same church, reappear in Gai's work.
What must be either the companion or, more probably, 
one of three companions for the Ashmolean's angel was 
exhibited at the Heim Gallery, September 1984 (as no. 31), 
and belongs to the London art dealer Daniel Katz. It has a 
black varnish much worn to expose a brassy metal like that of 
the Ashmolean's bronze, with traces of gilding, and the name, 
date, and device chiselled in the same style on the side of the 
base. Since the right foot of Mr Katz's angel is advanced and 
his head turned to his left he must have been placed on the 
other side of the altar to the Ashmolean's angel, but since his 
hands are joined in prayer it seems likely that he was matched 
by another in an equivalent attitude. Beside Mr Katz's angel 
there was perhaps one with his left hand to the breast in 
adoration, more or less a mirror image of the Ashmolean's.
The workmanship and material of these angels by Gai is 
characteristic of other Venetian eighteenthcentury bronzes; 
the same brassy colour and extensive chiselling is found, for 
example, in similarly sized figures by Francesco Bertos (active 
1693-1734) of SS Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola_
lot 118 at Christie's, London, 3 July 1985. Gai, who was 
(according to Tomaso Temanza, Zibaldon, ed. N. Ivanoff 
[Civilita~6 veneziana: Fonti e testi, 6, 1st series 3] (n.d., 
[1963]), 29) apprenticed to a wood carver, is recorded as 
executing numerous works in wood, stone, and marble all 
over the Veneto (see the list compiled by Camillo Semenzato 
in La scultura veneta del seicento e del settecento (Venice, 
1966), 131-2), but only one commission for a bronze is 
documented. This was for the gates of the Loggetta of the 
Campanile of Piazza San Marco in Venice upon which we 
read `ANT. GAI ET FILII. VEN. INV. FUS. & CAELAR. 
MDCCXXXIV.', which is an unusually explicit statement of total 
responsibility for modelling, casting, and tooling. There can 
be little doubt that Gai (or his sons Francesco and Giovanni) 
had considerable experience in this medium; he could not 
otherwise have been awarded such an important commission. 
And yet the two altar angels described above are the only 
other two works in bronze that can be associated with him.
These angels may (as suggested above) have been 
commissioned as small variants on Aspetti's, and the gates of 
the Loggetta obviously had to be in a style congruous with 

the sculpture and architecture of Sansovino, but Gai was in 
any case inclined to revive a sixteenthcentury style in reaction 
to the followers of Bernini. He consistently avoided bustling 
drapery, deep shadows, broken outlines, and dynamic torsion 
in his figures. In this conservatism Gai was doubtless 
encouraged by the most important arbiter of taste then 
resident in Venice, Consul Smith, whose patronage he 
enjoyed and who was responsible for sending some of his 
works to Britain_`Atalanta', `Meleagro', and `Senatori 
antichi' are cited in a contemporary source (Temanza, op. cit. 
31).
A Meleager in marble, 143 cms. high, and dated 1735, was 
sold at Sotheby's, London, 22 April 1986, lot 48 (the vendor 
was anonymous, but the sculpture was included in a 
photograph of private rooms at Castle Howard published in 
the World of Interiors magazine). This figure is very close to 
the Ashmolean's angel especially in the flattened and straight
lined folds of drapery but also in the manner in which the 
figure's left hand is caught in the drapery and the foot projects 
beyond the circular base. The Swedish diplomat and collector 
Nicholas Tessin noted that no sculptor in Italy was more 
highly esteemed than `le grand Gai', this `demi MichelAnge', 
`si fort gÃ¢tÃ© par les Anglais qu'il demande et obtient 80 
seguins pour la moindre petite Statue' (O. SirÃ©n, Dessins et 
tableaux de la Renaissance italienne dans les collections de 
Sue~6de (Stockholm, 1902), 109). A much damaged statue by 
Gai, rescued from an English country house park, survives in 
a private garden in Oxford.



Possibly by Gaetano GANDOLFI (1734-1802)
37. Fortitude
43.4 cms. (height); 27.5 cms. (length)
Terracotta of a pale beige colour. There are traces of some dark 
colour on the ground and many traces of gilding, for instance on 
the figure's right breast, on the lion's right ear, and in the follic 
les 
above his upper lip. There are also traces of gesso, most obvious 
under the figure's right forearm, which was presumably a preparation 

for the gilding. Several of the straps over the biceps of the figure' 
s 
left arm are missing and there has been a small loss to the lion's 
right ear. The group was modelled in two parts and joined before 
firing, doubtless in order to facilitate the hollowing of the clay. T 
he 
base, lion, and draped legs were modelled together with the figure's 

left hand and a portion of drapery. The join across the figure's righ 
t 
wrist and the drapery in her left hand is apparent and there is a 
small aperture where the belly meets the front fold of drapery.
The group is first mentioned in a letter of 7 March 1960 from the 

dealer David Carritt to Sir Karl Parker: `I have just bought somethin 
g 
which would amuse you very much: a terracotta group representing 
Bologna as a lady sitting on a lion, the work of Gaetano Gandolfi. 
I shall send you some photographs.' A letter enclosing these and 
giving the price of Â£275 was dated two days later. The sculpture 
was bought with the assistance of the Regional Fund administered 
by the Victoria and Albert Museum and registered on 4 June 1960.
The terracotta is likely to be a modello for a larger sculpture 
in stucco or marble which has not been identified (it may 
never have been executed or may have been destroyed). It is 
designed to be seen from several points of view and is 
compelling but somewhat simplified from behind which 
suggests a position on the canted podium at the corner of a 
freestanding, or a boldly projecting, monument.
The sculpture was attributed to Ubaldo Gandolfi by
K. T. Parker in the Annual Report (1960: 66) `both on 
stylistic and circumstantial evidence'. The `circumstantial 
evidence' would appear from a note in the Register to have 
been the dealer's claim that it was acquired from a descendant 
of Gandolfi in Bologna_presumably there was a tradition 
that it had been made by a member of the family. No details 
of this transaction, of the family's history, or of their heirlooms 
generally are given in the correspondence with David Carritt, 
whose nose for concealed treasures and deftness at extracting 
them, was, however, proverbial and who is unlikely to have 
invented the story. Both Ubaldo (1728-81) and Gaetano 
(1734-1802) Gandolfi, leading painters and engravers in 
Bologna in the second half of the eighteenth century, are 
known to have made clay models as part of the preparation 
of their paintings. Gaetano is documented as the author of 
the competition reliefs in terracotta which survive in the 
Accademia Clementina in Bologna. There is no proof that he 
was given sculptural commissions later in his career but various 
terracottas have been attributed to him, including the 
remarkable polychrome Lamentation group in the sanctuary 
of the Madonna di S. Luca in Bologna of the 1780s. Ubaldo 
is documented as having designed the large statue of Diana 
in the garden of Casa Savioli in 1773 (also partially executed 
by him but with much assistance from Giovanni Lipparini) 
and as having modelled in 1780 the imposing stucco figures 
of Isaiah and Jeremiah for the new church of S. Giuliano in 
Bologna. (R. Roli, `Aggiunte e precisazioni sui Gandolfi 
plasticatori', Il Carobbio (1976); E. Ricco~6mini, Vaghezza e 
furore: La scultura del settecento in Emilia e Romagna 
(Bologna, 1977), 123-4). Ubaldo's declamatory stucco 
prophets (Ricco~6mini, op. cit., 201-2) differ greatly in style 
from the Ashmolean terracotta. Gaetano's documented reliefs 
are closer, although they present no obvious similarities, and, 
if we accept the `circumstantial' evidence pointing to 
authorship by one of them, then Gaetano (Carritt's 
candidate) must be preferred to Ubaldo. If all that was known 
of the Ashmolean terracotta was that it came from Emilia
Romagna one would perhaps be inclined to attribute it to 

Antonio Trentanove (b. c.1740, d. 1812) in whose work one 
can find the same broad heavy drapery treated with an easy 
fluency. The lion which he modelled for his St Mark in
S. Lucia, Forl~@~6, also has the same comic face as the one
here (Ricco~6mini, op. cit., pl. 119).
A sample was taken by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the 
Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History 
of Art in March 1987 and thermoluminiscence tests 
suggested that it had been fired between 1727 and 1827 (ref. 
381z94).

Vincenzo GEMITO (1852-1929)
38. Emperor Charles V
22 cms. (height including socle); 5.5 cms. (height of socle); 
5.8 cms. (length and width of plinth of socle)
Bronze with a dark chestnut brown patina worn to a paler brown 
in some salient or smooth areas. Hollow, lostwax, cast. Traces of 
plaster core (and animal hair bonding) in interior, and a line of 
flashing inside the neck. The turned portion of the socle with its 
plinth are separately cast and soldered to the projection below the 
chest. `500' is chiselled in the interior of the socle. `OPRIETA~h 
ARTISTICA' (for `Proprieta~6 artistica') is incised in the model acro 
ss 
the side of the plinth of the socle at the back and `GEMITO' is incis 
ed 
in the model on the back of the projection below the chest. A minute 

foundry stamp in the metal to the edge of the chest to proper left: 
`FONDERIA / GEMITO / NAPOLI' has slipped to read 
`FOND / GEMERIA / NAPITO / . . .l'
Purchased on 6 October 1987 from Anthony Roth Fine Arts Ltd, 
49 Maddox Street, London, for Â£6,000, with the fund established 
by Dame Helen Gardner.
A lifesize fulllength statue of the Emperor Charles V was 
commissioned from Gemito by King Umberto I in 1886 for 
the fa}ade of the Palazzo Reale in Naples as one of a series of 
eight statues of the city's illustrious rulers (or at least eminent 
viceroys). The commission, together with another for a silver 
centrepiece, precipitated a mental collapse in the artist who 
was admitted in 1887 to an asylum from which he immediately 
fled. The statue had to be completed by another sculptor 
using Gemito's design. Gemito's original wax model for the 
statue is in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan (L. Caramel 
and C. Pirovano, Galleria d'Arte Moderna: Opera 
dell'ottocento F.M. (Milan, 1975), no. 1032, pl. 1030). This 
bronze may be an abbreviation of such a preliminary sketch. 
In any case it is possibly identical with the `esquisse de Charles 
V', a bronze exhibited by Gemito at the Exposition Universelle 
of 1900 in Paris where his lostwax casts, of which this is a 
superlative example, had been enormously admired since the 
success of his Neopolitan Fisherboy at the Salon of 1878 and 
his portrait of Meissonier completed in 1879. Gemito had 
established his own foundry by 1883_`geloso di Cellini', as 
he informed Meissonier (S. di Giacomo, La vita e l'opera di 

Vincenzo Gemito (Naples, 1905), 121)_but how active this 
was, and indeed how active Gemito was, during the period 
of about twenty years after he fled from the asylum and 
became a recluse is not clear, nor are the exact degree and 
duration of his mental illness (see the admirable review of the 
conflicting evidence by P. Fusco in `Medusa as a Muse for 
Vincenzo Gemito (1852-1929)', J. Paul Getty Museum 
Journal, 16 (1988), 127-8 n. 6). We have no record of other 
casts of this bust, but it is unlikely to be unique. A bronze 
statuette of the whole length figure is in the Museo di 
Capodimonte, Naples (IC 4110).

After Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) (1529-1608)
39. Woman at the bath
33.2 cms. (height including integral base)
Bronze with a natural patina of olive green and pale tan with vestige 
s 
of blackened varnish. A few traces of plaster in the hollows. The 
interior blocked with wax. No obvious evidence of tooling. `B.420 
' is painted in white on upper surface of base behind the foot.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed by him 
in 1899. B. 420 in his catalogues. For the circumstances of its displ 
ay 
when in his collection see Nos. 112-15. It was then placed upon a 
shaft of green fossil marble for which see the bust of Henri IV (No. 

299). Purchased in Rome `about 1853' according to both the large, 
and the notebook, catalogues, but `bt. Rome 1851' according to 
the preliminary catalogue compiled in 1856 (38), and possibly 
identical with the `Venus XVc' purchased by him before 1851, 
together with a Spinario and the miniature version of Michelangelo's 

Pieta~6 (No. 60), according to his manuscript `memoranda of prices 
paid'.
Fortnum described this a few years after he had purchased it 
as `Venus stepping from a Bath after the marble in the Villa 
Ludovisi known as the Venus of M. angelo' (preliminary 
notebook catalogue, 38), but he considered that it was `in 
the style of Giovanni da Bologna'. A bronze statuette 
(24.8 cms. high) of this same figure with the artist's name, 
`IOANNES BOLOGNA ~^@ BELGA', chiselled on its base, in the 
Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (no. 5874), has been 
plausibly, but not certainly, identified as the Venus by 
Giambologna presented to the Emperor Maximilian II by the 
Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. If so, however, 
he returned to the theme when he carved the nearly lifesize 
marble now in the American Embassy in Rome (the Ludovisi 
Venus to which Fortnum alludes) for Giovanni Giorgio 
Cesarini in 1583 (C. Avery, Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 
107, pl. 101). There are numerous bronze versions of this 

figure, all of them larger in size than the signed one in Vienna, 
but differing only in minor details_the treatment of the fringe 
of the drapery by the feet and of the coiled hair, for instance. 
Many of these are very close to the version in the Ashmolean 
Museum, not only in size and details, but in finish (there 
being little evidence of tooling in the metal, as Fortnum 
observed). Some were being made in Florence by the early 
seventeenth century and one was among the group of 
statuettes presented in 1611 by the Grand Duke Cosimo II 
de' Medici to Henry, prince of Wales (K. Watson and
C. Avery, `Medici and Stuart: A Grand Ducal Gift of 
``Giovanni Bologna'' Bronzes for Henry Prince of Wales 
(1612)', Burlington Magazine, 115 (1973), 493-512). It was 
described in the inventories of King Charles I as `a stoopeing 
standing woeman upon one leg . . . her left hand on her left 
nipple' (ibid. 506).
A list of bronzes of this type is given by William Wixom in 
his Renaissance Bronzes from Ohio Collections (Cleveland 
Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, 1975), under no. 148. This 
list, however, includes variants in which the drapery consists 
of one continuous piece of cloth. There are fine versions of 
this variant, among them that on loan to Cleveland Museum 
from the Bishop family (ibid., no. 148), as well as very poor 
nineteenthcentury sandcasts (see for example the example 
in the reserve collection of the Fogg Museum, Cambridge, 
Mass., 193713). It cannot be proved that this variant was 
invented by Giambologna. It relates to another figure of a 
nude woman at the bath attributed to him, which is known 
in statuettes of a smaller size, among them another in Ohio 
(ibid., no. 149) and the gilt bronze in the Herzog Anton 
UlrichMuseum, Brunswick, which was one of the most 
exquisite objects in the Giambologna exhibition of 1978
(C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: 
Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 
1978), 64, no. 5). In this latter variant the goddess's left foot 
is also on a step and a length of drapery is raised to her left 
breast in her left hand, but her right arm is drawn across her 
body and her head is turned to her right shoulder. This pose 
would seem to derive from the sculptor's group of Florence 
Victorious over Pisa (of 1565-70) but with the female nude 
reversed and deprived of an abject enemy. Its complex, 
continuously winding rhythm has an irresistible appeal, but 
as narrative the other versions are more enticing_providing 
a glimpse of beauty, intimately occupied, unconscious of our 
admiration. Narrative is reintroduced into the sinuous variant, 
however, by the addition of an infant whose squalling supplies 
the pretext for her turned head (as in the bronze in the 
Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich_Avery and Radcliffe, 
op. cit. 66, no. 9).
It is clear that elegant variations on these bronze statuettes 
were being devised by other sculptors within Giambologna's 
own lifetime, among them the `L.P.' whose initials appear, 
with the date 1579, on the exquisite boxwood statuette in 
the Museum fu~8r Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt on Main (St. 12, 

Oskar und Ilse MulertStiftung). A reduced variant with 
continuous drapery was modified to form a companion for 
an equally free variant on the antique Callipygian Venus (see 
Die Bronzen der fu~8rstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein 
(Liebieghaus, Frankfurt on Main, 1987), 166-7, nos. 10
and 11).
Among versions close to the bronze in the Ashmolean 
Museum are the following: Wallace Collection, London 
(S. 110), NelsonAtkins Museum, Kansas City, Missouri (31
54_not listed by Wixom), Poldi Pezzoli Museum, Milan 
(Piccolo Museo Mario e Fosca Crespi, FC. 24/68), Fairhaven 
Collection, The National Trust, Anglesey Abbey, 
Cambridgeshire (Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit. 63, no. 2, not 
listed by Wixom), Menil Foundation, Houston, Texas (ibid. 
63, no. 3, listed by Wixom as with Michael Hall Fine Art 
Inc.), BerlinDahlem, Staatliche Museum, inv. 1966
(W. Bode, Bildwerke des KaiserFriedrick Museums, ii: 
Bronzestatuetten, Busten und Gebrauchsgegensta~8nde (Berlin 
and Leipzig, 1930), no. 156, pl. 50). But there are minute 
variations in the treatment both of the hair and of the base.

After Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) (1529-1608)
40. Venus at the bath
35.1 cms. (height from plate attached to plinth); 0.1 cms. (height 
of plate attached to plinth); 0.8 cms. (height of plinth); 6.2 cms. 
(length of projecting attachment)
Bronze, firegilt. The gilding is worn in parts to reveal a natural d 
ark 
brown patina. Minute traces of a ruddy varnish remain in the figure's 

right armpit, on her left calf, and on parts of the drapery. There is 

some verdigris in hollows of drapery. Hollow cast, in parts. There 
are joins on the upper part of the figure's right arm, on her right 
thigh, and below the knee of her left leg. There are patches above 
and below the join on the arm, on the figure's shoulder. The back 
is extensively patched. There is a firing crack in her left foot. The 

original plinth of the figure is extended to proper right by means of 

a separate piece of bronze_both are attached to a plate of bronze 
below. Screws in the back of the pedestal fix it to a block of metal, 

the projection of which, beneath the hollow base, is cased in wood.
The bronze is attached to the Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet (purchased 
1949) for which see No. 35.
The Venus is derived from one of Giambologna's most popular 
inventions, his Architecture, also known as Geometry. The life
size marble version of Architecture formerly in the Boboli 
Gardens is in the Bargello in Florence (C. Avery, 
Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 100-4, pls. 95-6b). Of the 

bronze statuettes the finest is the signed version in the 
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (40.23; see C. Avery and
A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the 
Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 72, 
no. 17) and one in the Louvre which may well be the one 
described in the seventeenth century (when in Girardon's 
collection) as `fait par Messer Jean Boulogne et reparÃ© de 
Soucine'_`Soucine' being Antonio Susini (ibid.). Most casts 
of the figure appear to have been made from a slightly 
defective model, with a part of the set square, for instance, 
missing. Lists of versions are given by E. Dhanens, Jean 
Boulogne (Brussels, 1956), 165 n. 2, and W. Wixom, 
Renaissance Bronzes from Ohio Collections (Cleveland 
Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, 1975), no. 150. The 
Ashmolean's Venus, however, which has not been previously 
discussed in the literature on the sculptor, departs deliberately 
from its prototype. A large comb replaces the set square, 
protractor, and dividers in the right hand, and, instead of the 
drawing board supported behind the figure with her left arm, 
this figure has been given a shell. To accord with the theme 
of bath and toilet the hair, instead of being tied up in elaborate 
knots above the diadem, is gathered in a looser bun behind 
and falls freely over the shoulder. The necklaces are omitted 
and there are variations in the drapery, no longer intended 
for a smock, which falls over the figure's seat.
The bronze was perhaps acquired, together with the pietra 
dura cabinet it crowns, in Florence, by Lord Malton (later 
2nd marquis of Rockingham) in the late 1740s, but it would 
seem, from the improvised character of its base fixture, to 
have been adapted to serve this purpose. It may well have 
been gilded or at least regilded at the same time. There seems 
no good reason for a bathing Venus to preside over a collection 
of coins, but it is unlikely that Rockingham originally intended 
his cabinet to serve this purpose. If the bronze was acquired 
separately by Rockingham it might be the bronze Venus 
costing 8 guineas which was sent to him by Richard Hayward, 
the sculptor and dealer, on 22 April 1773 (and paid for 28 
June)_no. 40 among the `Vouchers for Works of Art',

41. Hercules and the Erymanthian 
Boar
45 cms. (height to boar's back left trotter); 43.7 cms. (height to 
boar's front right trotter); 10.2 cms. (height of plinth); 24.2 cms. 

(length of plinth); 20.2 cms. (width of plinth)
Bronze with a deep russetgold varnish largely blackened, partially 
worn and scratched to reveal a natural pale tan patina. Hollow, 
probably lostwax, cast. There is much tooling: in particular, the 
club is covered with punched marks in an undulating pattern. The 
figure is bolted to a mahogany plinth, toned and varnished to match 

the bronze. Rough platforms below the feet are just visible where 
they are attached to the plinth.
Presented in memory of Otto Gutekunst by his widow in 1953. 
Registered on 15 July. The bronze had been bought in at Christie's, 
London, 25 June 1953, where it was lot 11 (already with its present 
plinth).
The group, representing the fourth labour of Hercules, was 
cast in silver from a model by Giambologna, as one of a series 
of six groups commissioned by the Grand Duke Francesco I 
de' Medici for the Tribuna in the Uffizi. The casting of this 
group by Michele Mazzafirri took place in 1589, but the 
model might have been made some years previously, for work 
began on the commission in 1576. The earliest bronze version 
to be documented is the example in the Kunsthistorisches 
Museum, Vienna (5846), which is recorded in the inventory 
of the Kunstkammer of the Emperor Rudolf II compiled 
between 1607 and 1611 (see C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), 
Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria 
and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 122-3, for the series 
generally, and 126, no. 79 for this model; see also C. Avery, 
Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 141-5, for the series). The 
version in Vienna is the only one in which the hair of the 
hero is bound with a fillet; it is also of higher quality than any 
other.
Far more bronze versions of this group exist than of any 
of the other groups originally in the Tribuna: it is hard to 
believe that this reflects especial esteem for the model, which 
possesses rather less of either grace or drama than many of the 
others. The Annual Report for 1953 mentions that six other 
versions are recorded. This is an underestimate. W. Bode 
illustrated one in his Italian Bronze Statuettes of the 
Renaissance (London, 1907-12), iii, pl. CXCVII (private 
collection, Milan); another was illustrated by Planiscig in his 
Piccoli bronzi italiani del Rinascimento (Milan, 1930), pl. XI, 
no. 17; one was sold with the Castiglioni Collection in Vienna 
on 25 November 1925. There are versions in the Museo 
Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples (10785; Avery and 
Radcliffe, op. cit. 125, no. 78); the Metropolitan Museum, 
New York (198260100, published by J. D. Draper in The 
Jack and Belle Linsky Collection in the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art (New York, 1984), 154, no. 69); the National Gallery 
of Art, Washington (19429121); the Museo del Castello 
Sforzesco, Milan; the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, 
Florence; the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore (54.679); the 
Wallace Collection, London (S. 125).
With the exception of the version in Naples which is a 
reproduction made in the late nineteenth century and that at 
Baltimore which has exceptionally precise tooling and is 
attached to an irregularshaped bronze base, all these museum 
versions resemble each other very closely. Details of modelling 
(for example, the treatment of veins on the hero's left hand) 
and finishing (for example, the punching on the bark of the 
club) are identical and the only obvious differences are the 
curls of the boar's tail, which is easily bent out of place, and 

in the colour of the bronze, which, however, always shows 
evidence of an original warm varnish. These versions are 
generally catalogued as Florentine and seventeenth century, 
but in no case is there a provenance to prove that they were 
made before the last century. They do resemble very closely 
a version, one of a set of four of these Labours, from 
Wentworth Woodhouse, sold at Christie's, London, 15 July 
1986, lot 47, and catalogued as likely to have been one of the 
bronzes by Giambologna acquired by Lord Malton (later 2nd 
marquis of Rockingham) in Florence in the late 1740s (see 
his letter to his father of 1 September 1749, Wentworth 
Woodhouse Muniments, M2). However, the very careful and 
full inventories of Rockingham's collection do not list the 
group. A version of the bronze which also closely resembled 
the casts under discussion was sold at Sotheby's, London, 11 
December 1986, lot 72. It was possible to examine this closely, 
and it turned out to be a sandcast assembled out of four 
elements (the boar together with the hero's left arm; the club; 
the hero's right arm; the hero's torso and legs) in a manner 
typical of Parisian foundries in the last century. The nature of 
the varnish would make the joins hard to detect in many of 
the examples cited above.

Mercury flying
24.8 cms. (height); 1.3 cms. (height of marble base)
The body of Mercury is of bronze with a green varnish worn to 
expose a natural brown patina where handled on the legs. Hollow, 
presumably lostwax, cast. Helmet, the two wings attached to it, the 

wings attached to the ankles, and the head of the wind god, all of 
bronze firegilt, and each separately cast and attached. The band 
across the chest and loop of flying drapery of pliable metal (probabl 
y 
copper) firegilt. Mounted on a base in the form of a disc of white 
Carrara marble.
Purchased from the dealer David Carritt in 1960 for Â£75. The 
transaction took place around 7 March when Carritt wrote to assure 
Parker of his confidence that the gilt accessories were original. 
Registered 5 May 1960.
Giambologna was commissioned by the Grand Duke Cosimo 
I de' Medici in the second half of 1564 to execute a flying 
Mercury the size of a `fanciullo di 15 anni' as one of several 
diplomatic presents for the Emperor Maximillian II. Large 
and small versions were made over the next twenty years, the 
status and dating of which are much debated (a variety of 
opinions may be extracted from C. Avery and A. Radcliffe 
(eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici 
(Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 83-8, 
nos. 33-5). The figure was much copied throughout 

subsequent centuries. By the late eighteenth century it was 
adapted to carry candles. Among the sketches and reports 
from Rome sent by Charles Heathcote Tatham to the architect 
Henry Holland in 1795 are two designs for candelabra by 
Giuseppe Boschi (see No. 15), one of which is a `Mercury of 
Florence'_in fact Giambologna's famous figure_balanced 
on a ball of `oriental alabaster' placed upon a circular pedestal 
of `red porphyry' with `bronze mouldings gilt in french gold'. 
There is a short branch in his raised right hand and a larger 
one in his left. As a pair Boschi proposed `the celebrated 
Antique fame in the Collection of the Empress of Russia' with 
the candles arising from the basket she holds aloft. Each was 
2 feet 10 inches high including pedestals and the pair was 
priced at `250 Roman scudis equal to abt. Â£58 English'. A 
pair of Mercurys but slightly larger, with different pedestals 
and supporting several branches of Empire design, is to be 
found in the Royal Palace, Madrid. The Ashmolean's bronze 
is inferior in execution and design. The folds of the drapery 
are simply pressed ridges. The little wings look stuck on to 
the helmet and ankles with no idea of growing from them, 
the features of the face are inarticulate, the extremities are 
inexpressive, and there is no life in the modelling of the torso, 
even below the crude varnish. It may well be English and of 
about 1800 as Parker suggested (Annual Report (1960), 66) 
and if so perhaps a poor imitation of a bronze by Boschi.


After Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) (1529-1608)
43. Rape of the Sabines
29.9 cms. (height); 26.5 cms. (width)
Verde di Prato (Tuscan serpentine). Broken into eight principal, and 

two smaller, pieces. Some pieces missing.
Found in fragments in the basement in 1979. Provenance unknown.
This is a very poor copy, probably made in this century, of 
Giambologna's relief of the Rape of the Sabines incorporated 
on the base of the marble group of that subject which he was 
carving in October of 1581 and which was unveiled in the 
Loggia dei Lanzi on 14 January 1583. A smaller version 
(9~^V12 cms.) of similar quality and also in this material is in 
the reserve collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 
(52. 1942).


Unknown foundry and unknown modeller (perhaps 
Francesco Fanelli)

Probably after Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) 
(1529-1608)
44. Seated peasant boy with 
bagpipes
9.1 cms. (height)
Bronze with a pale tan natural patina rubbed to a brassy yellow on 
salient points. Hollow, lostwax, cast. Mounted on a block of 

serpentine. Inscribed in black ink `1460.1888'.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 19 August 1887, given in 1888. 
B. 416 in his catalogues. `Bought at Geneva' according to his 
notebook catalogue, presumably after 1857 when the preliminary 
catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled. Fortnum noted 
that the bronze was gilt. C. F. Bell added a note that this was paint 

(perhaps gilding on a gesso coating) which he had cleaned off in 
1902.
Among the group of bronzes sent from the Grand Duke 
Cosimo II de' Medici as a diplomatic present to Henry
prince of Wales in 1611 was `uno Pastore che suona la piva'
(K. Watson and C. Avery, `Medici and Stuart: A Grand Ducal 
Gift of ``Giovanni Bologna'' Bronzes for Henry Prince of 
Wales (1612)', Burlington Magazine, 115 (1973), 505). 
Statuettes of the type in the Ashmolean have been plausibly 
associated with this `pastore'. They must be related to another 
only slightly less common statuette of a rural figure, a peasant 
or shepherd leaning crosslegged on a staff. Next on the list 
of bronzes sent to England in 1611 was `uno Pastore che 
s'appoggia a uno bastone'. These two figures are also found 
together as a pair in the Museo di Palazzo Venezia, Rome 
(Collezione Auriti, Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Rome, 1964), 
pls. 37 and 38; at present displayed in the fifth case to the 
right of the second room of bronzes), and look very much as 
if they were designed together_the standing figure listening 
to the seated performer. A `Villano' described as leaning on 
a staff and a `pastore' appear together on a list (discovered in 
the Florentine archives by James Holderbaum) of silver 
statuettes, evidently recently made, which were loaned in 1601 
from the Galleria of the grand duke to Antonio Susini, 
Giambologna's most talented Florentine pupil, presumably so 
that further versions of them could be cast. The models of 
these silver figures are likely to have been by Giambologna: 
in any case we know from the inventory of Benedetto Gondi's 
collection in Florence in 1609 that Giambologna made at least
one Pastorino (C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna,
1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert
Museum, London, 1978), 164-5, nos. 135-7).
Statuettes of the seated bagpiper fall into two categories. 
There are rough casts, such as the Ashmolean's, all with 
minor variations and often with losses (thus, the example in 
the Wernher Collection at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire 
(no. 476), has no mouthpiece, and the horn is lost below the 
figure's left hand, the head is fitted further back, and the hat 
is of slightly different shape). The most familiar and least crude 
of these rough casts was the one published by Bode (Italian 
Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii, 
CCV), today in the Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem (2242, 
in reserve, see Ex aere solido: Bronzen von der Antike bis zur 
Gegenwart. Eine Ausstellung der Stiftung preubischer 
Kulturbesitz Berlin (Berlin, 1983), 148, no. 79, entry by
M.T. Suermann). It has a certain amount of texturing on 
bag, trunk, and drapery. Of far finer finish, and plausibly 

associated with the workshop of Antonio Susini, are the 
statuettes, of approximately identical size, in Palazzo Venezia 
(already mentioned), in the Bargello (no. 464, formerly in 
the Uffizi, gilt), in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 59
1956), in the Fitzwilliam Museum (M. 21961), and in the 
Liechtenstein Collection (formerly Bardini Collection; Die 
Bronzen der fu~8rstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein (Liebieghaus, 
Frankfurt, 1987, no. 22) and lot 83, Sotheby's, London, 10 
April 1975. Of these the Fitzwilliam version has most detailing 
(stops in the pipe, texture on the sack, fringes to the clothes) 
and it, together with the Sotheby's 1975 version, includes a 
feather in the hat which is reproduced in some of the rougher 
versions.
The rougher versions are not merely inferior derivatives but 
have considerable character. Their authorship was not 
discussed in the Giambologna exhibition catalogue (Avery and 
Radcliffe, op. cit. above). They resemble the bronzes by 
Fanelli (see Nos. 491, 492), who might have had access either 
to the version in the English Royal Collection or to one in 
his native Florence. His work on this scale has the same 
roughness, his casts are of very similar weight, and his metal 
is often close in colour.
Fortnum in his notebook catalogue observed simply that 
the bronze was `Italian XVIth Century'. In his large catalogue 
he wrote, `This doubtless represents one of the ``pifferari'' (of 
the period) who still make their music at Roman and other 
shrines at ``natale'' and may probably be of Roman 
workmanship'. C. F. Bell, annotating this, noted the superior 
quality of the Liechtenstein version and also that Bode had 
proposed a connection with Giambologna, speculating, 
because of their `Netherlandish character' that they were early 
works by him (Renaissance Bronzes in the Pierpont Morgan 
Collection (London, 1908), p. xxii). There may well have been 
a tradition of small statuettes of lowlife subjects north of the 
Alps before there was one in Italy. A boxwood figure of a 
player standing with crossed legs attributed to the Nuremberg 
school and dated c.1600 in the Cleveland Museum of Art may 
be representative of such a tradition. This figure is derived 
from a print by Du~8rer and Charles Avery has suggested that 
Du~8rer's prints were an inspiration for Giambologna as well 
(Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 47, pls. 35 and 36).

Perhaps Antonio Susini (active by 1580; d. 1624)

Probably after Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) 
(1529-1608)
45. Pacing stallion, wearing a 
saddlecloth
23.2 cms. (height); 24.7 cms. (length); 13.8 cms. (height of 
wooden plinth); 28 cms. (length of plinth); 13.8 cms. (width of 
plinth)
Bronze with a uniform dark browngreen patina. Hollow, lostwax, 
cast. Tiny firing crack on the front standing leg. Tooled with great 


precision and highly polished. Fixed to a base of ebonized wood.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed 1899. 
No. 445 in his catalogues. No date of acquisition recorded but 
presumably after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it 
is not recorded, was compiled.
A very similar horse, with the same action, saddlecloth, and 
cropped mane and tail dressing, but somewhat larger (42 cms. 
in length), is included in the bronze relief of the Grand Duke 
Cosimo I's triumphant entry into Siena on the base of the 
statue of him by Giambologna erected in 1599 in the Piazza 
della Signoria, Florence. The horse in the colossal group 
which this base supports (cast 1592-3) is of a similar, but less 
neat, character, as Fortnum noted (although he missed the 
much closer connection with the horse in the relief ). It has 
been conjectured that the model for the small bronze may 
have originated as an idea for the colossal horse which, when 
rejected, was retained in the relief and then cast separately as 
a statuette. The invention is, in any case, clearly associated 
with Giambologna or at least with his workshop.
A cast such as this is a good example of the extraordinary 
quality of the work produced by members of that workshop, 
and in particular by Antonio Susini, in the decade or so 
following Giambologna's death. Other versions exist in the 
Bargello, Florence (golden red varnish, with an original oval 
bronze base), the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (dark 
redgold varnish), and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art 
Institute, Williamstown (dark patina similar to the 
Ashmolean's bronze, with a coat of arms engraved on the 
saddlecloth). These three casts were exhibited together in 
the exhibition Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the 
Medici at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1978 (nos. 155, 
156, 157). The compilers of that catalogue cite other versions 
in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm; the Museo 
Arqueolo~5gico Nacional, Madrid; the Art Institute, Chicago, 
but not this example nor those in the Museum and Art 
Gallery, Kelvingrove, Glasgow (SMT 107) and in the 
Faringdon Collection at Buscot Park, Oxfordshire. Inferior 
later casts with minor variations (for instance in the tail and 
top knot) are also known (one was lot 114, Christie's, 
London, 5 December 1989).
Fortnum observed of this `highly finished & well modelled 
figure' that it was `perhaps French, & by P. Dupetit circa 
1768'. This was due to a similarity with a bronze at Windsor: 
however Fortnum's own notes on this subject reveal an 
uncharacteristic carelessness. Among his books preserved by 
the library of the Department of Western Art is a 
photographic album of the bronzes in the Royal Collection 
at Windsor. Accompanying this is a memorandum dated 21 
May 1875, from which we see that Fortnum noted of one of 
the bronze horses in a corridor `Horse same model, differing 
in details from mine'. This is in fact a statuette of the horse 
ridden by Cosimo on the monument itself. After it Fortnum 
wrote, `signed on base Pr ~^@ DUPETIT. 1768'. But, as someone, 
perhaps Fortnum himself, subsequently observed, this name 

was in fact chiselled on the base of a similiar neighbouring 
equestrian statuette_as can indeed clearly be seen in the 
photographic album_and the memorandum is corrected by 
an arrow. The error reveals Fortnum's open mind about 
dating and also draws attention to the similar taste for a satin 
finish and precision detailing which prevailed in Paris in 1760 
and Florence in 1610. It is not in fact at all unlikely that some 
of the bronze equestrian statuettes after Giambologna were 
cast in France in the eighteenth century. Having made this 
connection Fortnum seems to have retreated from it and he 
added `if not from the atelier of Giovanni Bologna' in the 
large catalogue. The bronze is not likely to have had this 
uniform dark patina originally.

Probably follower of Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) 
(1529-1608)
46. Venus removing a thorn from 
her foot; Cupid by her side
12.5 cms. (height including integral plinth); 4.45 cms. (length of 
integral plinth); 3.3 cms. (width of integral plinth); 6 cms. (height 

of porphyry base); 7.8 cms. (length of porphyry base); 6.5 cms. 
(width of porphyry base)
Bronze with a pale, slightly olive, tan natural patina and considerable 
remains of a ruddy gold varnish (well preserved on Venus' proper 
right thigh and on the neck of Cupid). Hollow, lostwax, cast. There 

are many casting flaws: the plinth is of uneven thickness and of an 
irregular shape with an untidy aperture below the tripod stool; the 
end of part of the drapery beside Cupid has been broken off; there 
is a crack at the contact of Venus' thigh with the drapery. There is 

much evidence of filing. A rectangular patch in Venus' left buttock 
may be discerned in a good light. `B. / 426. / ' is painted in white 

on the scroll foot of the stool behind the figures. The group is 
mounted on a block of porphyry with a moulded plinth of ebonized 
wood.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the 
same year. B. 426 in his catalogues. `Bought 1867', according to 
the large catalogue_in Florence for Â£4 from the dealer `Dr Foresi' 
(for whom see the introduction), according to his notebook 
catalogue. Fortnum had the bronze mounted on a yellow marble 
base. C. F. Bell exchanged this for the porphyry base as he noted 
in pencil in Fortnum's large catalogue.
Fortnum described this bronze in his notebook catalogue as 
`an elongated figure with a mannered grace after the manner 
of Gian Bologna', and in his large catalogue as `an elongated 
figure with a mannered grace characteristic of the later period 
of John of Bologna's followers or fabrique'. According to an 
annotation in Fortnum's larger catalogue, Bode regarded it 
as by Giambologna himself, but most scholars today would 
prefer Fortnum's more cautious formulation. The pose of 

Venus certainly seems to depend upon some of 
Giambologna's inventions involving women with raised knees 
(most notably the marble Florence Triumphant over Pisa of 
about 1570 in the Bargello, Florence) and the pose of the 
Cupid is strongly reminiscent of the continuous spiral that 
Giambologna devised for the Apollo in the Studiolo, although 
it also recalls inventions of Michelangelo and Raphael. The 
group may be associated with several other small bronzes of 
nude women in elegant attitudes ostensibly prompted by the 
activities of the toilet: above all, the Venus standing on one 
foot unfastening her sandal (Ca d'Oro, Venice, D. br. 60) 
who has a very similar hair dressing and is the same size; also 
the nymph cutting her nails (No. 326).
The finest surviving example of this group of Venus and 
Cupid is certainly that in the Metropolitan Museum, New 
York (32.100.183; C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), 
Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria 
and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 67, no. 10), which is 
more detailed and more cleanly finished than the Ashmolean 
group, with a similar, but better preserved, ruddy gold varnish. 
Among Giambologna's followers Antonio Susini seems likely 
to be responsible for this group. Anthony Radcliffe has pointed 
out the similarity between the Cupid in the New York version 
and the Child in the larger group of the Virgin and Child in 
the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, which seems to 
correspond to a group documented as an original work by 
this sculptor (ibid.). It is noteworthy that the type of stool 
that Venus rests her foot upon is much the same as that upon 
which David sits in the group signed by another member of 
the Susini family, Giovanni Francesco (Die Bronzen der 
fu~8rstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein (Liebieghaus, Frankfurt, 
1987), 196-7, no. 30).
The Ashmolean's bronze must be supposed to be a later 
cast, having much the same relation to the New York version 
as the Ashmolean's little bagpiper (No. 44) has to the neater 
casts of that figure. It should, however, be distinguished from 
other much rougher casts of the some group in which there 
is a small mound under the feet of the stool, the scrolled feet 
of the stool are different, and the aperture between Cupid's 
bent left and straight right leg is smaller or nonexistent. 
These tend to be a little larger in size (usually 13.7 cms. high): 
examples are in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 150
1910), the Museo Schifanoia, Ferrara (R. Varese, Placchette 
e bronzi nelle Civiche Collezioni (Ferrara, 1975), 144, 
no. 132), and the collection of Sir Brinsley Ford (where there 
is also a version in red wax); one such was also recently for 
sale in London (lot 75, Sotheby's, London, 20 April 1989).
In addition there are versions of the Venus without the 
Cupid in the MusÃ©e des BeauxArts, Dijon (see Avery and 
Radcliffe, op. cit., no. 8), the Staatliche Museen, Berlin
Dahlem (1967), and the Liebieghaus, Frankfurt (St. P. 378). 
Of these the Dijon version is of a quality comparable with the 
New York group.
The composition seems to have been familiar all over 

Europe by the early seventeenth century and was employed 
by the Dutch goldsmith Thomas Bogaert as the supporter of 
one of a pair of silver gilt salts made in Utrecht in 1624 
(Sotheby's, Geneva, 14 November 1988, lot 18). An ivory 
version of the group considered to be Italian and of the 
second half of the seventeenth century is in the Bayerisches 
Nationalmuseum (R. 4732).


Perhaps by Giovanni Bologna (GIAMBOLOGNA) (1529-
1608)
47. Selfportrait wearing the Cross 
of the Knights of Christ
13.5 cms. (height)
Wax covered with discoloured paint, flaking to reveal a battered 
surface. Chips at the lips reveal the original red of the wax. There 

are cracks in the bust across the proper left side. The bust is crude 
ly 
reinforced with plaster of Paris in the hollow behind. On the pine 
base is an old paper label inscribed `B FAC / A. G. B. Russell'_from 

an exhibition at the Burlington Fine Arts Club. Another larger and 
older one inscribed in ink in an Italian hand, perhaps of the 
eighteenth or early nineteenth century, `modello originale di Gio 
Bologna Cos . . . . . Primo' is pasted on the front face.
Bequeathed by A. G. B. Russell KCVO, JP, Clarenceux King of 
Arms, who died in 1956. No. 19 on the receipt of works in the 
bequest collected from Mrs Stedall on 8 October 1958. Acquired 
by Russell before 1913 when exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts 
Club.
The old label on the bust would seem to suggest that the 
Grand Duke Cosimo I was believed to be the subject. This 
might be a mistake from an earlier label describing 
Giambologna as Cosimo's court sculptor. E. Dhanens (Jean 
Boulogne (Brussels, 1956), 108-9) accepted that Cosimo was 
the sitter and supposed that the cross hanging on his chest 
was that of the Order of S. Stefano, founded by Cosimo in 
1561 with himself as Grand Master. H. Keutner, reviewing 
Dhanens (Kunstchronik, II (1958), 326), pointed out that 
the Cross is not the Maltese Cross of that order, but the 
Cross worn by the Knights of Christ, an order to which 
Giambologna was admitted in 1599, and remarked justly that 
the person depicted resembled Giambologna in the drawing 
by Goltzius of 1591 (Teylers Museum, Haarlem). He 
speculated that the portrait might be by Pietro Tacca. There 
is also a close relationship with the small bronze busts 
convincingly proposed by Charles Avery as portraits of 
Giambologna of which there are examples in the 
Rijksmuseum and the MusÃ©e des BeauxArts, Dijon, and in 
the collection of Sir John PopeHennessy (C. Avery and
A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the 
Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 168, 
nos. 143-5).

In 1964 the Ashmolean's bust was displayed with a label 
attributing it to Leone Leoni and suggesting that the sitter 
was Philip II of Spain. PopeHennessy, then Keeper of 
Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum, urged that this 
should be changed. An association with Giambologna 
obviously exists but `the poor state of preservation does not 
permit a positive identification of its author' (C. Avery, 
Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 277, no. 203).

Giuseppe Domenico GRANDI (1843-94)
48. Alessandro Volta
66 cms. (height including integral plinth)
Bronze with a dark green and brown patina and a slightly granular 
surface. Hollow, lostwax, cast. In the sloping moulding at the front 

of the plinth `A VOLTA' (with the `A' and `V' interlaced) is incised 

in the model (with conspicuous burr) and to proper left side of the 
same moulding in smaller letters `GRANDI' is chiselled in the metal.
Sotheby's, London, 21-2 March 1985, lot 296 bought (hammer 
price Â£900) by Anthony Roth. Bought for Â£1,800 from Mr Roth 
in January 1986 with funds from the Madan Bequest.
Conte Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) was one of the greatest 
scientists of his age. The volt is named after him. The bronze, 
which perhaps records a sketch for a projected public statue, 
probably dates from the 1870s. Carlo Bozzi (in `Artisti 
contemporanei: Guiseppe Grandi', Emporium, 16 (1902), 
91-108) refers to `Il Volta pure cos~@~6 pieno di carattere e di 
vita, che vale un monumento e chi si vuole sia stato 
improvvisato nel marmo' and reproduces a statuette 
presumably in clay or plaster corresponding to this bronze 
but with more obvious tooling in the folds of the coat (ibid. 
99). R. Boccardi (`Giuseppe Grandi', Rassegna d'arte, 21 
(1921), 201) refers to a `statuina in marmo' and reproduces 
the same work. No version in any material other than bronze, 
and no other version in bronze, has been traced, but the 
figure was reproduced as no. 681, pl. c in the catalogue of the 
`Manifattura di Signa. Terre cotte aristiche e decorative' which 
had showrooms c.1910 in Rome, Turin, and Paris.
Grandi was perhaps influenced by the brief popular 
biography by Luigi Alfonso Girardi (I contemporanei italiani: 
Galleria Nazionale del Secolo XIX (Turin, 1861) ) in which 
the solitary walks which Volta took on the city walls of Pavia 
in the last decade of his life and the gravity of his deportment, 
the artless neglect of his dress, and his broad, albeit 
corrugated, brow are memorably sketched. He must also have 
consulted the marble bust by G. B. Comolli dated 1828 
(Museo d'Arte Moderna, Milan). If there was a plan for a 
statue to him (and it was a period in which statues of almost 
every eminent Italian, ancient and modern, were projected) 
then it would have been likely to have been for Pavia, where 
Volta became professor in 1775, rather than for his native 
Como where there was already a statue of him by Pompeo 
Marchesi.

Grandi first attracted public notice by winning the 
competition for the monument to Cesare Beccaria (Palazzo 
di Giustizia, Milan) signed in 1870 and unveiled on 19 March 
1871 in Palazzo di Giustizia, Milan (the marble figure is now 
in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan, no. 1111, and has 
been replaced by a bronze replica). The bozzetto for the figure 
was cast in bronze (examples are in the Museo Nazionale 
d'Arte Moderna in Rome and the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, 
Milan) and so too was his sketch, dated 1880, for a statue of 
Marshal Ney. These are both smaller than the bronze of 
Volta, but of similar patina and finish and with a similar plinth. 
The Ney would seem to have been cast in a large edition_
versions are in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan, in the 
David Daniels Collection (exhibited Minneapolis, 1979-80, 
no. 63, previously Shepherd Gallery, New York, 1974), and 
two have appeared in recent years with London dealers. All 
three statuettes, but especially that of Volta, possess a dynamic 
plasticity and an exaggerated, almost grotesque, 
characterization suggestive of developments in France of 
which Grandi knew nothing: Daumier's earlier Ratapoil 
(No. 274) and Rodin's later Balzac (No. 309) both come to 
mind.
In 1881 Grandi won the competition for the huge bronze 
monument in Milan commemorating the Cinque giornate_
the popular uprising of 19-23 March 1848 against Austrian 
rule_for which he completed the halfsize model in 1886 
and which was only just completed in bronze when he died. 
To this work, perhaps the most powerful and original public 
monument of the second half of the nineteenth century in 
Europe, he devoted most of the last fourteen years of his life. 
For the influence of his ornamental designs and novel ideas 
for bust sculpture which he had pioneered in the 1870s see 
No. 83. The Ashmolean's statuette of Volta is the only work 
by Grandi on public view in this country with the exception 
of the extraordinary Kaled, al mattino del conflitto di Lara 
(Il paggio di Lara) of 1872 which stands in a high niche on 
the street front of no. 193 Fleet Street in London_`una 
meraviglia di vita e insieme un magnifico, secentistico, 
esempio di modellatura spigliata e di insieme decorativo, ma 
che, esposto a Brera [in 1873], ancora peggio che incompleto, 
procuro~6 al Grandi tali amarezze' (Bozzi, op. cit. 98).

Antonio GUSELA (dates unknown)
49. Saturn devouring an infant boy
21.5 cms. (height including integral pedestal); 4 cms. (height of 
integral pedestal); 6.9 cms. (length of pedestal); 4.1 cms. (width 
of pedestal); 2.8 cms. (height of modern plinth)
Probably lime, highly varnished_the varnish has given the wood a 
redder appearance than normal and has darkened in the hollows. 
The group is carved from two pieces. The vertical join may be 
discerned down the cheek of Saturn and the sides of his body: his 
right leg and left arm are fashioned for the most part from one block 

and left leg and right arm from the other. There is a slight split in 

the lower left leg. `Antonio Gusela / Sculto.re de Belluno' is writte 
n 
in black ink in an old hand in a hollowedout area behind the 
pedestal. The long `s' is easily read as a `g' or `z' and the next le 
tter 
could be a `z', `a', or `e'. `M 232' is written in pen with black ink 

on the back of the hourglass and on the base of the pedestal to 
proper right. The group has been mounted on an unmoulded 
mahogany plinth.
Bequeathed by J. Francis Mallett who died 7 January 1947. Received 
in the Museum during the last week of May 1947. No. 232 in the 
inventory of his bequest (as a work by `Gugela'). Valued by Mallett 
at Â£10. Acquired by him from `Christie 1937'.
The group looks as if it might be derived from a bronze 
statuette, but it is obviously not designed to be seen from 
behind. The shape of the pedestal suggests that it must date 
from the first half of the seventeenth century or later (compare 
the socle of Dieussart's bust of Prince Rupert, No. 471), but 
it could certainly be an eighteenthcentury work. The little 
brackets incorporated into the front of the pedestal to 
accommodate the projections of the feet are an unusual 
feature. Belluno, in the Venetian Alps, was noted for its native 
woodcarving. It was the birthplace of Andrea Brustolon 
(1662-1732), much of whose work may be seen there. 
Among Brustolon's pupils listed in a document of 1722 is 
Giovanni Battista Alchini known as Gusela. This Gusela was 
noted as a carver of frames. Among works by him are the 
Madonna del Carmine in the church of Loreto in Belluno 
and a crucifix in the collection of the Avvocato A. da Borso 
also in that city (G. Biasuz and M. G. Buttignon, Andrea 
Brustolon (Padua, 1969), 14, 307 n.). Antonio Gusela is likely 
to have belonged to the same family.
Dr John Brazier who identified the wood as probably lime 
noted that it might be a fruit wood. It has previously been 
described as box.

50. Judith with the head of 
Holofernes
39.7 cms. (height); 17.6 cms. (length of integral plinth); 15.6 cms. 

(width of plinth excluding projection of sandal)
Bronze with a ruddy brown artificial patina simulating the natural 

patina of a coppery bronze, worn to reveal a yellow metal in some 
salient areas, notably the chin, nose, and hair. Hollow, sand, cast i 
n 
three pieces, the sword with the drapery caught up by it forming 
one subsidiary unit and the heroine's right arm another. To proper 
right of the plinth on the side `2480' is stamped in the metal.
Bought in Paris in 1965, apparently on 14 September, from the 
Heim Gallery.
Ladatte exhibited a terracotta of Judith at the Paris salon in 
1738 (no. 159) and another in the following year. The latter 
was the model for his marble version of 1741 (MusÃ©e du 
Louvre) which was his morceau de rÃ©ception at the French 
Academy where he was nominated professor in 1743, the year 
before he returned to his native Turin. The terracotta, 84 cms. 
high, acquired 1981 by the MusÃ©es d'Art et d'Histoire de 
ChambÃ©ry may be the statuette of 1739. A gilded terracotta 
in the Museo Civico, Turin (pl. 13 of L. Malle~6, `Traccia per 
Francesco Ladatte, scultore torinese', in D. Fraser, H. 
Hibbard, and M. Levine (eds.), Essays in the History of Art 
Presented to Rudolf Wittkower (London, 1967), 242-54), 
which differs in many minor details_the treatment of the 
belt, the drapery over the sword hilt, the heroine's hand in 
the hair of her victim's head_may reflect another model, and 
may even be by Ladatte himself if the loss of sharpness is 
explained by the ground covering the terracotta preparatory 
to the gilding. The bronze in the Ashmolean is a reduced 
copy of the marble differing in that the sword hilt is not 
curved downwards in the bronze (someone may have 
supposed that the curve was due to a clay model sagging and 
have corrected it) and in many small details, the texturing of 
the sash (far more subtle in the marble) and the treatment of 
the eyes (deeply drilled in the marble), for instance. Ian 
Robertson bought it as a work by Ladatte himself, who was 
indeed noted for his bronzes, but the type of cast and its 
assembly are typical of Parisian foundries in the last century 
and the work is mechanical, without any of the vitality of 
either modelling or tooling that is found in works by Ladatte 
himself, such as the clock surrounded by allegories of Time 
and military glory, or the harpy furniture mounts and the 
candelabra in the Palazzo Reale, Turin (reproduced in A. N. 
Cellini, La scultura del settecento (Turin, 1982), 206, 217, 
220). Ladatte is a sculptor little represented in British 
collections but the ormolu mounts on the fantastic mother
ofpearl stand in the Victoria and Albert Museum (W. 34
1946) attributed to Pietro Piffetti can be attributed to him 
on account of the helmet revealing its quilted lining which is 
part of the trophy nestling in the cross stretchers_an identical 
helmet lining is found in the Judith and in the terracotta 
group of the Triumph of Virtue of 1744 (MusÃ©e des Arts 
DÃ©coratifs, Paris, inv. 6313).Perhaps by Fran}ois LADATTE (Francesco Ladetti or 
Ladetto) (1706-87)
51 and 52. Pair of sphinxes
26.5 cms. (height of `Summer', 51); 25.5 cms. (height of `Winter', 
52)

Bronze with a blackened ruddy varnish worn in a few parts to expose 
the yellow metal. Heavy, lostwax, casts. There are holes drilled 
through the back left leg and the front left leg. There are firing 
cracks on the rump under the tail of the sphinx with its left fore 
paw raised (51) and in the tail of the other. Mounted, before late 
1987, with modern bolts on discoloured white marble bases, cut 
from a single piece of marble, obviously not original. This was 
replaced by dark mahogany moulded plinths made by Ray Ansty of 
the Museum workshop. Placed on display in the Chambers Hall 
Room in 1987, previously in reserve.
Given by G. Reitlinger, 1972, but only received by the Museum 
after the fire in his home in 1978 (see No. 13).
According to the donor, these were originally firedogs (which 
may well be correct) and solid (which is incorrect) and the 
heads are portraits `representing, according to Sir Francis 
Watson, Madame Parabe~6re, Mistress of the Regent Philippe 
Duke of Orleans, after the models made by Jacques Caffieri 
c.1715-20 for Chateau de Champs'. The idea that the royal 
French mistresses_or English actresses_of the eighteenth 
century were depicted in sphinxes in bronze, and porcelain 
was a very popular one in the early part of this century, 
probably strengthened by the pastiche sphinxes made in the 
late nineteenth century in terracotta and plaster incorporating 
heads of Madame du Barry and so on (striking examples were 
sold Christie's, London, 3 April 1985, lot 79). There seems 
no good reason at all to believe that there was any portrait 
element in these bronzes. On the other hand, the idea (also 
credited to Sir Francis Watson) that the two sphinxes may be 
connected with two of the Seasons, and may possibly belong 
to a series of four, is surely correct: in any case one sphinx 
(51) wears a rosetrimmed dress (for Summer) and the other 
(52) a furedged pelisse (for Winter).
Although there is something French about the ornamental 
character of these sphinxes neither the type of heavy cast nor 
the colour has convinced experts that they are French. They 
are reminiscent of the ornamental work of Francesco Ladatte 
at the court of Turin. In the gilt bronze harpies which he 
supplied for the furniture made by Pifetti for the queen's 
Gabinetto di Toletta in the Palazzo Reale soon before his 
second stay in Paris which lasted from 1734 until 1744 (see 
M. Bernardi, Barocco piemontese (Turin, 1964), 130) and in 
the allegories surrounding the great clock in the Palazzo 
Reale signed in 1775 (ibid. 49) we find the same taste for 
elegant female heads, fringed draperies, strung pearls, brocade 
with relief patterns and a textured ground, and the same 
sinuous outline broken by the projection of floral crowns and 
ribbons.
Jennifer Montagu, to whom I owe the suggestion that the 
sphinxes might be from Turin, pointed out that they probably 
supported shields with their raised paws. For other sphinx 
firedogs with shields see the pair in the Bayerisches 
Nationalmuseum, Munich (24106; H. Ottomeyer and P. 
PrÃ¶schel, Vergoldete Bronzen (Munich, 1986), i. 71, 
no. 1.10.10) and the pair signed by Euge~6ne Piat sold 11 June 

1989 at the Ho~7tel des Ventes, Troyes (Gazette de l'Ho~7tel 
Drouot, 2 June 1989).

53. Bust portrait of a cardinal
43.5 cms. (height, excluding socle); 17.4 cms. (length of base of 
socle); 15.8 cms. (width of base of socle); 11.5 cms. (height of 
socle)
Carrara marble. The foremost curl on the proper righthand side 
has been broken off (the point where it touches the collar remains). 

There are some rusty stains natural to the marble (most obvious in 
the cap), also some grey stains.
Purchased for Â£550 by the National ArtCollections Fund, 1959, 
and presented to the Ashmolean Museum. Said to come from the 
Lazzaroni Collection, Nice. Sir Karl Parker first appealed to the 
Fund on 30 June 1959 when the sculpture was on offer from Hans 
Calmann for Â£800. Lord Crawford, the Chairman of the Fund, 
replied from his castle in Fife on 22 July that the Committee had 
`felt a little uncertain about the Bust_or, rather, I should say 
whether we should pay up' because a bust of the same period `more 
certainly by Foggini' had been purchased by the Victoria and Albert 
Museum for a mere Â£80, not many years before. In view of this Ian 
Robertson, writing on behalf of the Keeper, reported on 1 August 
that Mr Calmann had lowered his price to Â£550. The grant for this 
amount had been made by October.
On acquisition this bust was attributed to GiovanniBattista 
Foggini (1652-1725), but Parker wrote in the Museum's 
Annual Report (pp. 45-6) that `an alternative and perhaps in 
some ways more probable' attribution to Giuseppe Mazzuoli 
(1644-1725) `is worth considering in conjunction with the 
problem of the sitter's identity'. He added that
No traditional or otherwise proven identification has been recorded; 

and though it is safe to reject the recent suggestion that the bust i 
s 
of Leopoldo de' Medici, a glance at the series of engraved portraits 

of cardinals of the period in question, published by Giovanni 
Giacomo dei Rossi, is enough to show the almost baffling difficulty 
of recognizing a subject with certainty when conventional standards 
of expression, attire, hairstyle, &c. were so universally adopted.
With this it is impossible to disagree; but Parker continued to 
claim that
Such features, however, as the unusually prominent nose, the wide
set eyes, the projecting lower lip, and the reflective, as it were 
withdrawn, expression of the face, point to Paluzzo Paluzzi degli 
Albertoni (1623-1698), who was raised to the purple in 1664 by 
Alexander VII, but came into power chiefly after the election to the 

Papacy of the octogenarian Clement X in 1670, and was by him 

permitted to adopt the name of the Altieri, a family long associated 

with the sculptor Mazzuoli.
The comparisons upon which this identification depend are 
not strong and the idea began, one must suspect, with a 
desire to clinch the attribution to Mazzuoli. Oddly the 
identification was accepted and because of it Klaus Lankheit 
proposed an attribution (made also by Hugh Honour) to 
Lorenzo Merlini (in a letter of 28 March 1960 to Mr Taylor 
and then in his Florentinische Barockplastik (Munich, 1962), 
185), noting that, according to an anonymous memoir and 
autobiography, Merlini made a `statua al naturale of Cardinal 
Paluzzo Paluzzi degli Albertoni' for Cardinal Lorenzo Altieri 
for the anticamera of his palace (Palazzo Altieri al Gesu~6) in 
Rome. Unfortunately for this argument Merlini's portrait_
almost a halffigure rather than a bust (hence perhaps the term 
`statua')_survives in Palazzo Altieri, and a terracotta for it 
(labelled as by Lorenzo Ottoni) is in Palazzo Braschi (see 
A. N. Cellini, La scultura del seicento (Turin, 1982), 106-7, 
pl. 4) and it does not resemble the bust in the Ashmolean. 
Moreover, even Merlini's best work (such as the effigy in the 
monument in S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini, Rome, illustrated in 
R. Enggass, Early EighteenthCentury Sculpture in Rome 
(Pennsylvania, 1976), figs. 90-2) does not approach the 
Ashmolean portrait in vitality and his modelling was always 
superior to his carving. It must be said also that none of the 
portraiture by Foggini or Mazzuoli has quite this sharpness 
of carving or mobility of features or is so utterly lacking in 
dull surfaces or gross handling. Lorenzo Ottoni's comparable 
portraiture in marble (for example, his bust of Pope Alexander 
VIII in the Sta~8dtische Galerie Liebieghaus, Frankfurt on 
Main) is not dissimilar but is cruder in its pursuit of effect, 
especially in the use made of the drill.
The sculptor working in the last decade of the seventeenth 
century, and the first of the eighteenth, who was most capable 
of work of this quality and character was Pierre Legros II. 
There are no comparable bust portraits by him but his 
recumbent effigy of Cardinal Girolamo Casanata, now partially 
concealed by the Germanlanguage confessional in S. Giovanni 
in Laterano (1701-3), and his statue of the same man in the 
Biblioteca Casanatense (1706-8), also in Rome, exhibit the 
same exaggerated features, grotesque in any other artist's 
work, combined with great vitality of expression, variety of 
profile, and exquisite treatment of detail. (The carving of the 
aged flesh of the neck at contact with the collar is remarkably 
close in the statue and the Ashmolean's bust.)
As was pointed out in the Annual Report of the National 
ArtCollections Fund, 56 (1959), 30, the shape of the bust 
strongly suggests that it was designed to be set in a circular 
frame. The socle upon which it is now mounted cannot be 
original.

After Antonio LOMBARDO (b. c.1458; d. 1516)
54. Portion of a frieze involving 

vine tendrils and a cherub
33.5 cms. (height); 89 cms. (length)
Plaster of Paris, somewhat grey and abraded (perhaps from damp), 
with some minor cracks and very irregular edges. Solid cast with no 
apparent seams. Set in a thick pine frame, serving also as a tray.
Provenance unknown. Possibly a residue of the Ruskin School's 
teaching aids.
The plaster cast is made from moulds taken of the frieze on 
the base of the north face of the pedestals of the two pilasters 
which form a triumphal arch distinguishing sanctuary from 
choir within the raised Capella Maggiore of S. Maria dei 
Miracoli in Venice. This church was erected between 1481 
and 1489 under the direction of Pietro Lombardo and his 
sons Tullio and Antonio, the latter being credited with this 
particular frieze, which develops, to either side of the portion 
represented here, into female sea monsters upon whose tails 
the putti are riding. The carving, which is among the most 
skilled and charming of its period in northern Italy, was much 
admired by the close of the nineteenth century. Comparison 
with the original reveals that the cherub's nose has been 
damaged since this cast was made. The cast might have been 
supplied by a firm such a Brucciani (see Nos. 450, 580, 581), 
in whose list, published before 1906, one finds a pilaster from 
this church, but it is unlike their work in its solidity and 
absence of seams and is no less likely to have been acquired 
in Italy.
Ruskin, in the Venetian Index appended to the third
volume of The Stones of Venice, considered the church of the 
Miracoli to be the `most interesting and finished example in 
Venice of the Byzantine Renaissance, and one of the most 
important in Italy of the cinquecento style. All its sculptures 
should be examined with great care, as the best possible 
examples of a bad style. . . . Its grotesques are admirable 
examples of the base Raphaelesque design', he continued, 
and urged his readers to
Note especially the children's heads tied up by the hair, in the late 
ral 
sculptures at the top of the altar steps. A rude workman, who could 
hardly have carved the head at all, might have been allowed this or 
any other mode of expressing discontent with his own doings; but 
the man who could carve a child's head so perfectly must have been 
wanting in all human feeling, to cut if off, and tie it by the hair t 
o 
a vine leaf. Observe, in the Ducal Palace, though far ruder in skill, 

the heads always emerge from the leaves, they are never tied to them. 

(E. T. Cook and A. Wedderburn, The Works of John Ruskin, xi 
(London, 1904), 393.)
Given the specificity of this reference, and the fact that one 
of his finest drawings given to the Ruskin School Collection 
(Educational Series 94) is of a portion of the same frieze, one 
must wonder whether this cast was not made at his instigation. 
As with his architectural daguerrotypes, the commissioning of 

casts is a relatively littledocumented aspect of his work as a 
historian and critic, but he presented casts to the Architectural 
Museum as early as 1854 (ibid. xii, p. lxxi) and also gave 
some, later in life, to the St George's Museum in Sheffield 
(ibid. xxx (1910), 189). We know that he obtained casts in 
Venice through his friend the Commendatore Giacomo Boni: 
those Boni made of the Colleone monument apparently 
disintegrated (ibid.). The church was extensively restored by 
the Besarel brothers for Count Roberto Boldu~6 in 1887 and 
that is a likely date for the making of casts on a commercial 
basis. However, an identical plastercast, in store in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum (1851-432), was acquired in 
1851.

55. Triumph of Ariadne
28.1 cms. (height); 38 cms. (length)
Bronze with a chocolate brown patina. Lostwax cast. A firing crack 
at upper righthand side with two plugs inserted in the bronze, of 
which one is now missing. The surface much scratched, especially 
at top left, perhaps in cleaning. `B. / 687 / ' painted in white in 
the lower righthand corner.
Lent in October 1874 by C. D. E. Fortnum and bequeathed by him 
in 1899. B. 687 in his catalogues. `Found in London among refuse 
old metal, rescued by the older Hatfield, the bronzist, who cleaned 
it and yielded it to me about 1856' (large catalogue). `I found this 

fine bronze in London. It had been rescued from the melting pot 
by Hatfield the bronzist, by whom it was cleaned from the 
accumulation of filth with which it was covered, and purchased by 
me' (notebook catalogue). It was not included in the preliminary 
catalogue compiled by Fortnum in 1857 and so was probably not 
acquired before 1858. It is likely to be the `Ariadne' in an MS 
`Memorandum of Prices Paid' which cost him Â£4 in 1858. It was 
exhibited at the Archaeological Institute in February 1861. In 
Fortnum's photograph it is displayed on a plain flat wooden 
moulding with a gold fillet at the sight edge. The present heavy 
walnut frame with gilt egg and dart and waterleaf mouldings was 
probably made by the Museum workshop in the 1950s to match 
the old Renaissance moulding found for the panel painted by Filippo 
Lippi.
Fortnum esteemed this relief very highly and expanded 
unusually upon its merits: a `work of great beauty and interest; 
the admirable treatment of the Satyrs, the calm grace of pose 
and expression in Ariadne; the spirit of the antique well 
sustained, but the best manner of the Renaissance equally 
apparent'. He recognized that it was a version of one of the 
two reliefs that adorn the Renaissance base made for the 
antique bronze statue of a nude boy known as the Idolino 
which was in his day in the Uffizi but is today in the Museo 
Archeologico in Florence, but he did not appreciate that this 
statue, believed originally to be a Bacchus, had been discovered 

in 1530 at Pesaro (for its history and reputation see F. Haskell 
and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London and New 
Haven, Conn., 1981), 240-1). The Idolino's base had been 
attributed, as Fortnum noted, to Vittorio, son of Lorenzo 
Ghiberti, by J. W. Gaye, (Carteggio inedito d'artisti, i 
(Florence, 1839), 108 n.), but Fortnum seems to have 
preferred the attribution to Desiderio da Settignano, being 
much struck by the exquisite low relief. Neither sculptor 
could, however, have been responsible for the base since this 
cannot have been made before the statue was discovered. 
Furthermore, it was not likely to have been made in Florence. 
The base is in fact known to have been made for Duke 
Giudobaldo II of Urbino, that is after 1538, and probably 
several decades later, but before 1574 (when he died). Ulrich 
Middeldorf (`Notes on Italian Bronzes', Burlington 
Magazine (Dec. 1938), 251-7) convincingly attributed it to 
the three sons of Antonio Lombardo (see No. 54). These 
Lombardi established a foundry at Recanati. The bronze 
tabernacles in the Cathedral of Milan of 1559-60 and at 
Fermo of 1570 and the bronze doors and font for the basilica 
at Loreto which are documented as by them are very close 
in style to the base of the Idolino both in the naturalistic 
ornament and in the unmannered classicism of the narratives.
It has not been possible to place the Ashmolean's relief 
next to the bronze in Florence but in both reliefs most of 
the detail (which appears in both to be reproduced from the 
wax model) is the same_for example, the pattern of fur at 
the top of the second satyr's leg as it meets the edge of the 
vine leaf, the rippling neckline of Ariadne's dress, the faintly 
indicated lion head on the hub of the chariot wheel. The relief 
in Florence appears to be more varied in depth and more 
vigorous in facial character; it also curves forward below feet 
and wheel; but, when parts of the two reliefs are measured, 
they correspond exactly: in both cases the chariot wheel is 
6.7 cms. in diameter, the wand 9 cms. in length (from top of 
Ariadne's thumb to tip), and the second satyr measures 
4.85 cms. in a straight line from under his right armpit to his 
left shoulder. This exactness would be remarkable if achieved 
by a copyist who would have to calculate the degree to which 
the bronze shrinks when cooling.
One must therefore respect Fortnum's idea that his relief 
was made in the same period and from the same model as 
the base (the reliefs, that is, were cast in bronze from two 
wax models which were cast from the same mould and tooled 
with reference to a common master version). What would 
seem unlikely is that it was a `rejected first casting' as Fortnum 
proposed, because, although there is a firing crack in 
Fortnum's relief, there are more serious flaws in the relief on 
the base_in particular a crack across the right arm and 
shoulder of the first satyr and a damaged area between the 
second satyr and Ariadne_as Fortnum himself observed in 
separate notes interleaved in his notebook catalogue.
It is, of course, just possible that the Lombardi's moulds 
and master version survived and were employed in a later 

period. That there would have been an interest in doing so 
in the second half of the eighteenth century seems probable 
since the Lombardi's style of relief uncannily anticipates the 
imitation of the antique which then became fashionable. A 
wax mould and a wax cast after the relief are recorded in an 
eighteenthcentury catalogue of models at the Doccia 
porcelain factory and orders were placed with Vincenzo 
Foggini for versions of the two reliefs on the Idolino's base 
on 12 June 1748_a wax cast survives in the Museum's 
collection (K. Lankheit, Die Modellsammlung der 
Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 1982), 136, and 
pl. 202). The Adam brothers had a plaster cast of the base in 
their collection and Robert Adam employed one in the 
furnishings supplied to Audley End in Essex where he worked 
from 1763 onwards. A study of the base is to be found in a 
sketchbook by Joseph Nollekens in the Ashmolean Museum 
(fo. 81). Terracotta casts of the relief, identified merely as 
`Bassorilievo greco', were illustrated as available for sale in 
the catalogue of the `Manifattura di Signa. Terre Cotte 
artistiche e decorative' which had salerooms in Florence, 
Rome, Turin, and Paris in the early years of the century 
(no. 381, pl. xxxviii in the copy belonging to the Sculpture 
Department, Sotheby's).

The colossal antique statue of which this is one of the earliest 

known reproductions seems to have been discovered in 1546. 
It had been placed by 1556 in Palazzo Farnese in Rome (see 
F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London 
and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 229-32, no. 46). For later 
copies of it in terracotta and bronze see Nos. 152, 414 and 
416. There are a series of four terracotta figures and groups 
of similar size signed by Maderno in the Ca d'Oro, Venice 
(D. sc. 79, 80, 81, 82). They represent Hercules and the Lion, 
Hercules and Cacus (both dated 1621), Hercules and 
Antaeus (dated 1622), and the group of a bearded hero 
holding a youth over his shoulder now thought to represent 
Neoptolemus with Astyanax (undated). The last mentioned is 
signed `St. M. ex' like the Ashmolean's terracotta, whereas 
the others are signed `St. M. f ', the `f ' for fecit perhaps being 
reserved for works which he had invented. It it tempting to 
speculate that Maderno devised the three groups of Hercules 
in action as companions for his copy of Hercules resting after 
his labours, although he is unbearded when struggling with 
the lion which is surprising if a series is intended. The 
Neoptolemus group has been interpreted in numerous ways. 
In Perrier's prints of antique sculpture published in 1638 it 
is identified as Commodus. Maderno may well have thought 
that it too represented Hercules. It is likely, in any case, to 
have been thought of as a companion for the terracotta Farnese 
Hercules since the marble originals were displayed together in 
Palazzo Farnese (the group is now in the Naples Museum 
(no. 150, inv. 5999) ).
Maderno may have made more than one version of these 
peices: another Hercules and Antaeus, dated 1620, is in the 
Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh (1981.1, from the Clerk 
of Penicuik Collection, said to have been bought in Italy in 
the 1720s), and this group was also reproduced in bronze 
(Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, 54.665), as was the Hercules 
with the Nemean Lion (L. Camins, Renaissance and Baroque 
Bronzes from the Abbott Guggenheim Collection (Fine Art 
Museums of San Francisco, 1988), 84-5, no. 28). Some of 
the Ca d'Oro terracottas have clean lines across the upper 
limbs of the figures. These cannot be caused by separate firing 
since that could not result in such neat joins. The terracottas 
must have been cut carefully into pieces, presumably to 
facilitate the taking of moulds, and then reassembled.
Maderno's Farnese Hercules is not a meticulously exact 
copy. The curls of hair and beard are, relatively, smaller in 
the marble. Here they are treated more like the lion's mane 
and with the same crisp tooling that is found in the groups 
in the Ca d'Oro, and the face has the same mean or pained 
grimace that seems to have been Maderno's only idea of 
expression. This is less true of a terracotta copy of the Farnese 
Hercules, unsigned and larger (82.08 cms. high), also in the 
Ca d'Oro which as been attributed to Maderno (B. Candida, 
Bronzetti, terrecotte, placchette rinascimentali di ispirazione 
classica alla Ca d'Oro e al Museo Correr di Venezia (Rome, 
1981), 57-9, no. 14).
Edmund Oldfield, former librarian and fellow of Worcester 

College, Oxford, presented the Ashmolean Museum with a 
choice collection of small classical antiquities_gold ear 
pendants, iridescent glass perfume flasks, mortuary diadems, 
Greek vases_on the occasion of moving house from Thurloe 
Square in London to Torquay (see his letter to Arthur Evans 
of 27 May 1899 in the Archives of the Department of 
Antiquities); he died at Torquay in 1902 and bequeathed 
some few additional items. The Hercules is identified in the 
manuscript list of objects presented in July 1899, section IV 
`objects separate from cabinet', p. 7. There seems to have 
been no other `modern' work, or at least no other avowedly 
`modern' work, in his collection (see, however, No. 165). 
Most of his collection is likely to have been assembled when 
he was travelling in Italy and the Mediterranean.
A sample was taken from the base of the figure by Mrs 
Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for 
Archaeology and the History of Art in 1973 and again in 
Mach 1987 and thermoluminescence tests suggested a date 
between 1573 and 1743 or 1537 and 1697 (refs. 81m61 
and 381z93).
Whilst this catalogue was in proof Sergey O. Androssov's 
important article `Works by Stefano Maderno, Bernini and 
Rusconi from the Farsetti Collection in the Ca d'Oro and the 
Hermitage' appeared in the Burlington Magaine (May 1991, 
pp. 292-7). Androssov shows that the terracotta Farnese 
Hercules in the Ca d'Oro is likely to be by Camillo Rusconi 
to whom he also attributes a terracotta Apollo Belvedere in the 
same collection. To the Maderno terracotta groups in Venice 
he adds four others Nicodemus with the body of Christ, dated 
1605, now in the Hermitage, a Herculese and Telephus, dated 
1620, a Herculese and the Centaur, dated 1626 (surviving 
only as a plaster cast) and a Laocoon, dated 1630. He 
demonstrates that it is likely that the works by both Maderno, 
Rusconi and Bernini in the Hermitage and the Ca d'Oro all 
came from the collection of the Abate Filippo Farsetti (1703-
1774).

This terracotta bozzetto and its companion (No. 57) are related 
to two of the statues of the Apostles commissioned by 1679 
for Siena Cathedral, executed in marble, apparently during 
the summer months of the years 1680 and 1695, and set up 
against the pillars of the nave in the latter year, replacing the 
trecento set which were placed in the skyline of the fa}ade. 
The St Philip was being executed in marble in 1687 and the 
St Matthew in 1689. This was the most important commission 
given to Giuseppe Mazzuoli who was born in Volterra, 
brought up in Siena, and a protÃ©gÃ© of Cardinal Flavio Chigi, 
`Cardinalenipote'_the Chigi being a Sienese family. 
Mazzuoli had studied in Rome under Ercole Ferrata and 
Melchiorre Caf a~6 and had executed the figure of Charity on 
Bernini's tomb of the Chigi pope, Alexander VII (see L. 
Pascoli, Vite de' pittori, scultori ed architetti moderni (Rome, 
1736), ii. 479-82; V. Suboff, `Giuseppe Mazzuoli', Jahrbuch 
der preu~^Wischen kunstsammlungen (1928), 37; F. Pansecchi, 
`Contribuiti a Giuseppe Mazzuoli', Commentari, 10 (1959), 
35; E. Carli, `Le statue degli Apostoli per il Duomo di Siena', 
Antichita~6 viva, 7 (1968), 3-20). The Apostles were removed 
from the Cathedral in 1890 after almost forty years of fierce 
debate (D. I. Romano, `Le statue degli Apostoli del Duomo 
di Siena ovvero una brutta pagina di storia senese', Paragone, 
26 (Nov. 1975), 85-100). They were purchased for the 
London Oratory in the Brompton Road in June 1895 on the 
strength of photographs of them in a warehouse in Genoa 
(A. Laing, `Baroque Sculpture in a NeoBaroque Setting', in 
M. Napier and A. Laing (eds.), The London Oratory: 
Centenary 1884-1984 (London, n.d. [1984]), 65-74). Other 
bozzetti connected with this commission survive. That for St 
Simeon Zelotes is in the City Art Gallery, Birmingham (see 
Heim Gallery, London, Faces and Figures of the Baroque 
(autumn 1971), no. 64); that for St Paul is in the Museo 
dell'opera del Duomo, Orvieto; that for St John the Evangelist 

was in 1965 in the possession of an American professor 
(purchased in Florence, coloured, somewhat larger_48 cms. 
in height_and with a square base); and gilded bozzetti for 
Christ holding the Cross and the Virgin Mary, two statues 
added to the series in Siena Cathedral but not purchased for 
the Oratory and now untraced, are in the Royal Scottish 
Museum, Edinburgh (also larger_46 cms. in height_see 
Heim Gallery, London, Seven Centuries of European 
Sculpture (summer 1982), nos. 21-2). Versions of several of 
these bozzetti (Paul, Philip, and Matthew) are also to be 
found in the Fondazione Accademia Musicale Chigiana in 
Siena, as is the only recorded version of the St Bartholomew. 
The bozzetti for Philip and Matthew in Siena are larger (42.4 
and 42.2 cms.) than those in Oxford, and more scratchily 
modelled in the head. That of St Philip is initialled `D.B.'
(M. Butzek, `Die Modellsammlung der Mazzuoli in Siena', 
Pantheon, 46 (1988), 75-102, pls. 33-6). The inventory of 
the vast collection of models and casts belonging to the 
Mazzuoli family which was compiled in 1767 specifically 
mentions two St Matthews as original clay models by Giuseppe 
(ibid. 88, no. 102, and 91, no. 107) and there are other 
duplications of this sort. The attributions in the inventory are 
unlikely to be entirely reliable, and it certainly seems as odd 
that Mazzuoli should have repeated himself as it seems natural 
for one of his pupils or family to have copied him. Laing (op. 
cit.) notes the significance in this connection of the fact that 
a nephew of Mazzuoli made fullscale replicas of the statues 
for the Collegiata of Sinalunga. Hugh Macandrew (notes in 
the Department's files) points out that there is a relationship 
between the Ashmolean's bozzetto (probably representing St 
Philip) and a St James the Less, one of a series of wooden 
sculptures, about 212 feet high, in the Museo dell'Opera del 
Duomo in Siena_another statue in the series, the St Jude, is 
also related to one of Mazzuoli's Apostles, but there is no 
reason to attribute these figures to Mazzuoli nor to call them 
bozzetti (as Enzo Carli does in Il Museo dell'Opera e la 
Libreria Piccolomini di Siena (Siena, 1946), 27).
The relationship between the Ashmolean's two bozzetti and 
the marble statues now in the Oratory has been admirably 
defined by Macandrew.
The St. Matthew is close to the full scale figure, except that in the 

latter the head is inclined more to the right and the Apostle looks 
directly at his gospel. In the larger format there is greater emphasi 
s 
on the front plane. The putto is turned more to the spectator while 
the Apostle's left foot and drapery are brought more to the front. . 
. . 
The other statuette is obviously connected with the Oratory's St. 
Philip, the essential differences being that in the latter the Saint 
is 
shown with his usual attribute, a Cross, which he supports under his 

left arm. Apart from this however and also the fact that in the large 

r 
format the head is turned up to the left, correspondence is very 
close indeed. Facial features are exactly similar as indeed are his 
stance, the folds of the drapery and the position of the right arm 
holding the book . . . it is possible that the modification was the 
result of the instability which is plainly evident in the bozzetto.
Documents do in fact reveal that Mazzuoli modified his St 
Philip when he was carving it (Butzek, op. cit. 89 and n. 104).


After MICHELANGELO Buonarroti (1475-1564)
59. Aurora
10.8 cms. (height from support below figure's right elbow to top 
of head); 18.7 cms. (length); 23.5 cms. (length of figure from 
top of head to broken end of figure's right leg); 22 cms. (length 
of base); 9 cms. (height of base); 8.9 cms. (width of base)
Red wax. The figure's left arm and right foot are missing. A large 
patch has been repaired on the upper part of the figure's left thigh. 

Repairs are also evident on the upper and lower parts of the left leg 
. 
There is an incongruous addition to the lower part of the right leg. 

Old adhesive is apparent where the figure is broken and on the 
drapery below. The surface of the figure is pitted, scratched, and 
cracked. The wax is mounted on an old wormeaten arched block 
of pine which retains on the square face behind the figure's back 
some original painted decoration consisting of a radial pattern of 
arabesques in gold against a dark ground with a gold border.
Gift of Chambers Hall, April 1855 (Donations Book, 28). Bought 
by him from one of the Woodburn brothers who bought it at a sale 
of Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection in 1830 (see below). Probably 
placed on display in 1856 (cf. No. 21). The wax is recorded in the 
Handbook Guides of 1859 and 1865 as on display with the paintings 
given by Chambers Hall in what is now the Founder's Gallery.
Michelangelo's marble statue of Aurora (Dawn) was executed 
between 1524 and 1531 for one side of the sarcophagus 
below the effigy of Lorenzo de' Medici duke of Urbino in 
the Medici Mausoleum in S. Lorenzo, Florence. It was never 
completed in the feet and drapery. An accurate small copy 
such as this wax might have been made as an exercise by 
another artist in the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth 
centuries. It could then have been adopted as a collector's 
piece, but is also finished enough to have been intended as 
such. Such wax copies were certainly sought after. Pierino da 
Vinci made one of Michelangelo's Moses for his patron in the 
midsixteenth century, and early seventeenthcentury Flemish 
paintings of collector's cabinets show small figures in red wax 
among the small bronzes of varied patina_for instance, the 
allegory of Sight signed by Jan Brueghel in 1617 (Prado, 
no. 1394) which includes a red wax statuette of the Antinous 
about 10 cms. high and what may be pink wax statuettes, 
rather larger in size, of Aurora companion with one of Night 
(from the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici).

The work is entered in the Museum's Donations Book, 
presumably in accordance with the donor's description, as 
`Wax Model, original by Michael Angelo, being the figure of 
Night in the Medici Chapel, formerly in the possession of Sir 
Thomas Lawrence'. The appropriateness of adding it to a 
collection which included the drawings by Michelangelo 
which had also belonged to Lawrence is obvious. In the sale 
of Lawrence's collection at Christie's, London, on 19 June 
1830, lot 346 was `A Wax Model, by Michelangiolo, of one 
of the recumbent female figures executed by him in marble 
in the Sacristy of the Church of St. Lorenzo at Florence', 
marked down to `Woodburn' for Â£14 3s. 6d. Presumably it 
was sold by Woodburn to Chambers Hall. Lawrence also 
owned a number of small groups and reliefs in wax attributed 
to Giambologna (ibid., lots 348, 349, 350, 357), of which 
two, bought at his sale by Richard Ford, survive in the 
collection of Sir Brinsley Ford (for one of these see No. 46). 
It is likely to be the reclining statuette mounted on a buhl 
plinth in the foreground of an anonymous engraving of 
Lawrence's sitting room in 65 Russell Square (K. Garlick, Sir 
Thomas Lawrence (Oxford, 1989), 27, fig. 4).

Probably an Italian goldsmith, perhaps of the seventeenth 
century.

60. Pieta
14.6 cms. (height of group); 6.7 cms. (height of plinth); 
12.25 cms. (length of plinth); 7.6 cms. (width of plinth)
Bronze with a pale chocolate patina, evidently an alloy very rich in 

copper. Thinwalled, lostwax, cast, open behind. All projecting 
elements seem to be hollow except perhaps for the right arm of 
Christ. The Virgin's thumb is broken off and there are dents in 
both of Christ's knees (damage already recorded in Fortnum's 
catalogues and photographs). A brownred wax has been used to 
plug a small hole within the deepest fold of drapery on the proper 
right side of the group; other pinsized holes remain in this area. 
Set in a plinth, rectangular in plan but with the front corners 
chamfered, made of a solid block of rosso antico with nero antico 
mouldings above and below. This is unlikely to be original, not least 

because the irregular form of the integral rockwork bronze base 
does not fit perfectly into the aperture for it and is surrounded by 

disfiguring cement. It looks like an Italian eighteenthcentury plint 
h. 
The bronze is painted `B. / 434. / .' in white on its hollow rear.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in March 1888, given later in the same 
year. B. 434 in his catalogues. No. 8, p. 38, in his preliminary 
catalogue of 1857, where it is stated to have been bought in Rome 
in 1851. On a sheet entitled `Memoranda of Prices paid' it is listed 

as an item acquired in or before that year, for 12 scudi, together 

with the small bronze Spinario and the Venus, i.e. the bathing 
woman after Giambologna, No. 39 (for 18 and 20 scudi), the total 
of 50 scudi translating as Â£10 12s. 6d. (The entries for these latter 

items in the preliminary catalogue both conclude `Rome 51', which 
confirms this date.)
Fortnum in his preliminary catalogue described this bronze as 
of `very light font' and of the `highest quality and finish'. He 
thought it Florentine and `worthy of Cellini'. In the notebook 
catalogue he considered it late sixteenth century, `probably' 
Florentine, and `possibly' by Annibale Fontana to whom a 
Crucifixion in the South Kensington Museum (Victoria and 
Albert Museum 74401860) was then attributed. Finally, in 
his large catalogue, he suggested that it was perhaps an 
example of Florentine goldsmith's work of the early 
seventeenth century. This last proposal seems highly 
probable; but it might be later in date. It is a work of very 
meticulous and miniature workmanship, equalled in this 
among the Ashmolean Museum's bronzes only by Nos. 385 
and 386_also early acquisitions of Fortnum's. The rippling 
edge of the robe, the blood from Christ's wounds, and the 
nails of fingers and toes are especially remarkable.
Michelangelo's marble Pieta~6, today in St Peter's, Rome, 
was commissioned for the church of S. Petronilla, by Cardinal 
Jean Villiers de la Groslaye, probably in 1497 and is supposed 
to have been completed by 1500. If the model for this bronze 
was made directly from the marble then it must have been 
executed before 1736 when four broken fingers of the 
Virgin's left hand were incorrectly restored by Giuseppe 
Lironi_the hand here corresponds to that in the sixteenth
century engravings. Small bronzes were being made after 
Michelangelo's marble sculpture during the sixteenth century 
when Pietro da Barga made one of the Risen Christ of S. 
Maria sopra Minerva. The Pieta~6 was copied in marble by 
Nanni di Baccio Bigio for the Florentine church of S. Spirito 
where it was installed in March 1549, so a model for the 
bronze statuette could easily have been made in Florence after 
that date.
While faithful in all essentials, the more minute particulars 
in the Ashmolean bronze do not correspond with those in 
the original. For instance, in the marble, the folds in the cloth 
over the Virgin's head are more broken; the Virgin's thumb 
as well as her fingers appears beneath Christ's right arm, and 
the fingers are opened; the rockwork base is more extended 
to the left of the base and is not so apparent in front of the 
group. The Ashmolean bronze is indeed less close to the 
original_and far more artistic in its modifications_than the 
other bronze copies of the group, all of which are between 
two and three times larger (Frick Collection, New York_
formerly Pierpont Morgan and Pfungst Collections, for which 
see J. PopeHennessy and A. F. Radcliffe, The Frick Collection 
. . . Italian Sculpture (New York, 1970), 196-8; another with 
Jacques Seligmann & Co., New York, in February 1937 when

Gallery, Buffalo_reproduced in the catalogue as no. 136; 
another sold Sotheby's, London, 10 April 1975, lot 85; and 
a fourth, with different drapery on the Virgin's chest, lot 111 
at Christie's, London, 3 July 1985).

61. Moses
39.8 cms. (height); 18.4 cms. (length from front of sandal to back

of Moses)
Bronze with warm slightly green brown natural patina with much 
varnish, in places now black, especially in the hollows. Hollow, lost 

wax, cast. The walls are of irregular thickness, with small perforati 
ons 
in the folds of drapery where the bronze is thinnest. The figure is 
open below and some core remains in the prophet's left foot. In 
some parts the cast is imperfectly cleaned (see the folds of drapery 

around the neck); in others, such as the head, it is boldly but preci 
sely 
chiselled. Remains of a small paper label with the word `Coll.' print 
ed 
in red are on the block in front of the prophet's left foot.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed in 
1899. B. 441 in his catalogues. `Bought at Christie's Â£30.' 
Presumably after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it 
is not mentioned, was compiled. Placed in the Students' Room of 
the Heberden Coin Room in 1956.
Michelangelo's celebrated marble Moses was carved for the 
tomb of Pope Julius II. The tomb was first conceived in 1505 
but the statue probably dates from 1513. It was abandoned 
in 1516 and set up in its present position in S. Pietro in 
Vincoli, Rome, in 1542. Small copies began to be made soon 
afterwards: according to Vasari one in wax was made by 
Pierino da Vinci. Fortnum supposed this `finely executed 
reduction after the statue by Michel Angelo . . . of rich 
coppery metal & fine dark patina', to be Italian of the 
seventeenth century or of the earlier years of the eighteenth 
century. Fortnum's dating may well be correct, but the bronze 
might be French rather than Italian. In any case it is in France 
that bronze statuettes of the Moses are found. Most notably 
in the Paris Salon in 1699 (Livret, 13) a group was exhibited 
consisting of a Christ, Moses, and John the Baptist on a pedestal 
`de marqueterie' (possibly buhl) and symbolizing the `union 
de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament par le venue de Jesus 
Christ'. The Christ was by `Fran}ois Flamand' (that is `Il 
Fiammingo', Duquesnoy), the Moses by `Michel Ange', and 
the John by M. Girardon. The `by' is misleading and it is 
surely possible that all three works were modelled by Girardon, 

although only the last was his invention. The group also 
features in the engravings, and in the posthumous inventory, 
of Girardon's collection_`le tout de Bronze mais sur un pied 
d'Estail de Marquetrie enrichi d'ornament dorez dor moulu'. 
The engravings reveal that Girardon rejoiced in making 
groups out of works of art independently conceived, but these 
seldom have a symbolic significance such as was suggested 
here. (F. Souchal, `La Collection du sculpteur Girardon, 
d'apre~6s son inventaire apre~6s dÃ©ce~6s', Gazette des beauxarts, 

82 (1973), 38-9, no. 16, fig. 17).
Bronze statuettes of Moses of both a larger and smaller size 
than the Ashmolean's are known: one 68.4 cms. high, thin
walled, with a ruddy varnish, was no. 35 in J. Fischer, The 
French Bronze 1500-1800, catalogue of an exhibition at 
Knoedler and Co. (New York, 1968), no. 35; another 34 cms. 
high, thinwalled, with a blackened red varnish, is in the 
reserve collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum (A.84
1910); a third, of high quality and very close in size to the 
Ashmolean's bronze, was lot 139 at Sotheby's, New York, 22 
June 1989. Souchal (op. cit.) notes that a bronze Moses, `11 
pouces, 9 lignes de haut', was included in the Royal French 
inventory of 1707 (unpublished MS, fo. 899) and that one 
`15 pouces de haut' was in that of Cardinal Richelieu
(L. Boislisle, `Les Collections des sculptures du Cardinal de 
Richelieu', MÃ©moires de la SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Antiquaires 
de France, 42 (1881), 87). The latter converts to a 
measurement only half a centimetre higher than the 
Ashmolean's bronze so that the two are likely to be cast by 
the same foundry or at least from the same model.
It is noteworthy that reproductions of Michelangelo's Moses 
were not among the bronze statuettes offered for sale in 
Rome in the late eighteenth century by Righetti and Zoffoli. 
On the other hand the Barbedienne foundry did make sand
cast bronzes of inferior finish and after mechanically 
reproduced models in the midnineteenth century.

Bronze with a natural pale greenybrown patina. Hollow, sandcast, 
in five pieces: the head; the figure's right arm from the shoulder to 

the hand, including the top portion of the baton; the figure's left 
arm from near the shoulder to the wrist; the figure's right leg, 
including a portion of the plinth; the rest of the figure including 
most of the plinth. Some of the joins are fine (that on the top of th 
e 
neck especially so, although the rivet is very apparent) while others 

are crude. Piecemould seams are visible in some places (e.g. his lef 

t 
shoulder). Much patching of casting flaws has been carried out in a 
different coloured alloy: the patch below the figure's left forearm i 
s 
apparently of lead. The metal is imperfectly cleaned and only in a 
few areas of flesh, most obviously the head, is it fully polished. Se

Given by R. P. B. Davies `late of 28, Wellington Square' [Oxford]. 
Registered on 23 March 1960.
The seated effigy of Giuliano de' Medici, duke of Nemours, 
brother of Pope Leo X, may have been first conceived by 
Michelangelo when he took on the planning of a new Medici 
Mausoleum in S. Lorenzo in 1520, and is probably the effigy 
which documents suggest to have been well advanced by June 
1526. It was placed in its niche before the autumn of 1534. 
This effigy was the most finished of the figures in the chapel 
(only the projecting right foot requiring further work). All 
the allegories and effigies of the Medici Mausoleum were 
much reproduced in France in the nineteenth century from 
models reduced by the machine invented by Collas which 
were cast by the Barbedienne foundry. The figures of Day 
and Night had been appropriately adapted as clock
ornaments in both the early and late eighteenth century (see
H. Ottomeyer and P. PrÃ¶schel, Vergoldete Bronzen, 2 vols. 
(Munich, 1986), i. 45 and 296; ii. 481). In the middle of the 
nineteenth century Collas and Barbedienne devised a massive 
chimneypiece clock involving not only the allegories of the 
times of day but the effigy of Lorenzo as `Le Silence', 
approximately 30 inches high. The Barbedienne catalogue 
of 1862 includes all six statues from the Medici tombs (see 
M.T. Baudry, Ministe~6re de la Culture, La Sculpture (Paris, 
1978), 326). Other foundries also reproduced these figures, 
among them the firm of Sauvage, which also incorporated 
Lorenzo's effigy into a mantel clock (see lot 98, Christie's, 
London, 28 September 1989), and the `Compagnie des 
Bronzes Bruxelles', one of whose casts of Lorenzo, 71 cms. 
in height, was lot 62W, Sotheby's, London, 10 June 1988, 
and another, of the same size, lot 302W, Sotheby's, London, 
5-6 November 1987. The Ashmolean Museum's bronze of 
Giuliano is unmarked but this is unsurprising since it is also 
unfinished. Given the patching, a darker artificial patina was 
obviously meant to be applied, but there would also have 
been much tooling to sharpen the detail and to make the 
joins less apparent. However improved, it is hard to believe 
that this would ever have been mistaken for anything other 
than a mechanical reduction_and one made from a plaster 
cast. Undercutting is avoided, for instance in the baton, and 
the drapery escaping from the armour on the figure's left has 
not been understood.

63. Keyhole escutcheon in the form 
of a grotesque winged mask

8.9 cms. (height); 11.8 cms. (width, wingtip to wingtip)
Bronze, firegilt.
Attached to the `Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet', for which see No. 35.
As discussed elsewhere in this Catalogue (under No. 35), 
some of the ormolu mounts on the pietra dura cabinet are 
likely to be original. The scroll feet, tendril volutes, and leaves 
may well be cast after models by Giovanni Battista Foggini 
but this escutcheon perhaps came from another, earlier, piece 
of Florentine furniture. It is a typical variation on a theme in 
Michelangelo's art, best represented by the front and back of 
the breastplate of the effigy of Giuliano de' Medici in the 
Medici Chapel in S. Lorenzo, Florence (for which see No. 62). 
Whereas such grotesque masks are most characteristic of the 
second half of the sixteenth century they continued to be 
popular in Florence in the seventeenth century and a distinct 
echo of them is found in some designs of the eighteenth 
century such as the handles of vases by Clodion (see Nos. 262, 
263) or the keyhole escutcheon of the silver microscope of 
about 1763 made for King George IV when prince of Wales 
by George Adams (Science Museum, London).

Egidio MORETTI (active between 1611 and 1638, d. after 
1651)
64 and 65. Pair of Romans in 
consular dress
213 cms. (height of No. 64, including integral plinth); 8 cms. 
(height of 64's integral plinth); 56 cms. (length of 64's integral 
plinth); 216.5 cms. (height of No. 65, including integral plinth); 
10 cms. (height of 65's integral plinth); 77 cms. (length of 65's 
integral plinth)
White marble of uncertain origin. The surface is severely weathered 
and discoloured with ingrained dirt (especially in the case of No. 65 
). 
There is a horizontal crack in No. 64 at hip level. The head of No. 6 
4 
looks original but was `pieced' (carved from a different block of 
marble) and inserted with the neckline of the drapery concealing the 

join. It is now loose and the join is very evident. A rusty iron cram 
p 
is exposed behind the neck. The scroll held in the figure's left hand 

and two fingers and the thumb of the hand itself have been broken 
off and replaced, with considerable additions in plaster. The irregul 
ar 
shape of the plinth is unlikely to be original. The head of No. 65 
appears to have been carved out of the same block as the body and 
the plinth but has been broken off and replaced: a large chip below 
the break is missing. The nose has been restored: the replacement 
is loose and of a darker colour. A large part of both forearms has 
been broken off and is missing. The figure's right stump has been 
cut and drilled to receive a new forearm and an iron cramp, but 
neither are now in place.
Given to Oxford University by the dowager countess of Pomfret 

(see Nos. 516, 517) in 1755. For the provenance see Nos. 66 and 
67. The statues may be discerned in William Westall's drawing of 
the sculpture gallery in the Old Schools signed in 1813. After 
transfer to the University Galleries they were certainly among the 
statues described in the Crypt or SubGallery but whereas one is 
surely described there as `a statue of a Roman Consul', the identity 

of the other is uncertain_it may be `a statue of Demosthenes' 
(Handbook Guide (1859), 23). No. 64 was taken out of storage in 
the mid1970s and placed on display in a niche in the Randolph 
Gallery on the initiative of Michael Vickers.
For Moretti and Arundel see Nos. 66 and 67. Although 
apparently not intended by Arundel as portraits, one at least 
of these statues had, like both companion Roman warriors, 
assumed a specific identity by the eighteenth century. Vertue 
described one of them as `A statue very noble, and bigger 
than the life of Quintus Fabius Maximus, in his senatorial 
robes (a true antique as are both the Scipios), the l. hand is 
wanting, the r. held up in a speaking posture'. The other was 
merely `a fine statue of a Senator in his robes' (quoted in
J. Hess, `Lord Arundel in Rom und sein Auftrag an den 
Bildhauer Egidio Moretti', English Miscellany, 1 (1950), 209). 
It is surprising that Vertue considered the statues to be 
antique. That the figures were modern does, however, seem 
to have been acknowledged in Oxford for Chandler did not 
include them in his Marmora Oxoniensia of 1763. It had 
been forgotten again by the time of the Handbook Guide of 
1859 in which they are recorded as antique. Michaelis regarded 
No. 65 as `very effective, but the whole statue seems to be 
new' and No. 64 to be of `similar style' but `coarser execution' 
and `likewise the work of a very clever modern imitator'. 
Michaelis noted that No. 64 was wearing the pallium, the 
common outer garment of a Greek citizen, and 65 the Roman 
toga, although in an unusual arrangement (Ancient Marbles 
in Great Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 553-4, nos. 46 and 
47), but it is clear from Arundel's contract with Moretti that 
both figures were intended to represent Romans in consular 
dress.


Egidio MORETTI (active between 1611 and 1638; d. after 
1651)
66 and 67. Pair of Roman warriors
224 cms. (height of No. 66 including integral plinth); 11 cms. 
(height of 66's integral plinth); 76.5 cms. (length of 66's integral 

plinth); 226.5 cms. (height of No. 67, including integral plinth); 
8.5 cms. (height of 67's integral plinth); 79 cms. (length of 67's 
integral plinth)
White marble of uncertain origin. The surface is severely weathered 
and discoloured with ingrained dirt (especially in the case of No. 
67). There is a crack across the plinth of No. 66. A large chip is 
missing from the front of the helmet, and also from the drapery at 
the figure's right elbow. The pommel and the blade of the sword 

have been broken off and do not survive. The figure's left arm has 
also been lost; its stump retains an old hole for securing an additio 
n 
and the marble may have originally been pieced here. In the case of 
No. 67 a large portion of the cloak crossing the chest has been 
broken off and lost, as has the figure's left arm and the sword in 
his right hand, together with part of the hand itself. The nose and 
lower lip are missing, the surface of both places has been cut to a 
convenient flat surface, scored, and fitted with an iron cramp from 
which restorations have since become detached. A small iron cramp 
is also evident in the figure's right hand. `AEGIDUS. MORETTUS. / 
ROMMANUS.FACIEBAT' is chiselled on the side of each plinth to 
proper left.
Given to Oxford University by the dowager countess of Pomfret 
(see Nos. 516, 517) in 1755. The sculptures are the `homini armati' 
which Moretti contracted to make for Thomas Howard, 2nd earl of 
Arundel, on 10 June 1614 in Rome together with a pair `in abito 
alla consolari' (Nos. 64 and 65) and which were all completed by 
25 January 1617 (J. Hess, `Lord Arundel in Rom und sein Auftrag 
an den Bildhauer Egidio Moretti', English Miscellany, 1 (1950), 
199-200; also, for a transcription of the contract, D. Howarth, 
Lord Arundel and his Circle (New Haven, Conn., and London, 
1985), 229-30 n. 40). The statues were acquired with a large 
portion of the Arundel marbles by Lady Pomfret's fatherinlaw Sir 
William Fermor (later Lord Lempster) from the 6th duke of Norfolk 
in 1691 and were for some years kept in the gardens of the family 
seat of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, although by 1632 they 
had `latterly almost all' been taken within doors (`The Vertue 
Notebooks', iv, Walpole Society, 24 (1935-6), 40). In Oxford the 
statues were displayed in the Old Schools and then transferred to 
the University Galleries where they are recorded in the Handbook 
Guide of 1859 in the Crypt or SubGallery but visible to the public 
(pp. 23-4 as `statues of Roman Emperors', nos. 113 and 119). 
They remained on display until the 1870s when they seem to have 
been put in store. In the late 1940s they were declared to be `lost' 

(one enquirer observed that the Museum's basement must have 
been remarkably compendious for colossal statues to disappear in 
them). They were traced by the mid1970s when one statue of this 
pair, No. 66, was placed on display in a niche in the Randolph 
Gallery on the initiative of Michael Vickers.
Egidio Moretti was a minor sculptor working in Rome in the 
early seventeenth century. He is documented as supplying 
sculpture for the Borghese Chapel in S. Maria sopra Minerva 
in 1611 and statues for the skyline of the fa}ade of St
Peter's in 1613, also as restoring antiquities for the Quirinal
Palace in 1623 and making a tomb for S. Bartolomeo in 1638
(Hess, op. cit. 213-14; see also S. Pressouyre, Nicolas Cordier,
2 vols. (Rome, 1984), i. 219 n., 303 n., and ii. 393). The 
contract between him and `Signor Tommaso' was for the 
four statues (these two warriors and the two men in consular 
dress, Nos. 64 and 65) to be ten palmi high and made within 
a year_`160 di moneta di paolo 10 per ciascuna statua finita 
nel modo sopradetto: in questo modo cioe scudi 60 ogni tre 

mesi anticipata da comminciare dal giorno che comminciera 
il lavoro et cosi sequitare fino al intiero pagamento facendo 
pero il lavoro che merita et denaro che se gli dara'. It is 
surprising that Arundel employed such a minor sculptor, but 
Moretti may have seemed to be a promising young man and 
when Arundel arrived in Rome in 1613, the betterestablished 
sculptors, such as Stefano Maderno, Pietro Bernini, and 
Nicolas Cordier, were fully employed. He may also have 
employed Moretti as restorer of the antique statues which he 
had acquired or which he hoped to acquire in Rome (certainly 
those exported in his name in 1626 were restored, as is clear 
from the document cited in No. 139). The four statues were 
evidently designed to be displayed in niches or against a wall 
for although the backs are finished they are of no interest. 
Contracts are not always an infallible guide to the precise 
identity of works of art but, if portraits of particular Romans 
were intended, then it seems likely that this would have been 
mentioned. By the eighteenth century, however, Vertue 
described them as `Two fine statues of the Two Scipio's in 
their general's habit, very perfect and exceeding fine' (quoted 
in Hess, op. cit. 209). He believed them to be `true' antiques, 
but when in Oxford they must have been recognized as 
modern works_Moretti's name is on the plinths and Lord 
Arundel's heraldic animals are carved on the fringes of the 
cuirasses_and they were not included in Chandler's 
Marmora Oxoniensia of 1763. In character they may be 
compared with the statues of Romans, and of modern rulers 
in the guise of Romans, found, for example, in Palladio's 
Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, in the Sala del Duecento of 
Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and, above all, in the Palazzo 
dei Conservatori in Rome_some, if not all, of which Arundel 
must have seen. The style of armour, the belt over the cuirass, 
and the treatment of the cloak recall Cordier's great bronze 
statue of King Henry IV of France erected in the Lateran in 
1609 and the helmets on the plinths recall those in his 
unfinished statue of St Sebastian of 1604-5 in the 
Aldobrandini Chapel in S. Maria sopra Minerva (Pressouyre, 
op. cit., pls. 64 and 136).


Francesco Maria NOCCHIERI (active mid to late 
seventeenth century)
68. Apollo, seated holding his lyre, 
attentive to the Muses
46 cms. (height); 25.75 cms. (length of base); 17.2 cms. (width 
of base)
Red terracotta with a pale pinky grey slip thickest where gathered 
in the hollows so that the salient ridges of the hair and clawed 
texture of the ground are pronounced. The projecting drapery is 
broken off behind the figure's right arm, as is the foremost loop of 

the drapery behind his left arm; the figure's right hand has been 
broken off very neatly.
Purchased apparently in 1950, but never registered and `mislaid' 

1965--6 (see below).
Queen Christina of Sweden commissioned a marble statue of 
Apollo from Nocchieri to complete a group of eight antique 
Muses which she had acquired. She projected a Chamber of 
the Muses for the sculptures in her palace (formerly Palazzo 
Riario, subsequently Palazzo Corsini) in the Via della Lungara 
in Rome after she was installed there in July 1659. The Muses 
were placed between sixteen Corinthian columns of giallo 
antico with gilded stucco captials against frescoes of 
landscapes_the Apollo was on a broader base in the centre 
of the short wall opposite the chief entrance (Christina Queen 
of Sweden_a Personality of European Civilization 
(Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, 29 June-16 Oct. 1966), 321, 
no. 741, pl. 62). Little is known of Nocchieri. He was a 
protÃ©gÃ© of Cardinal Azzolini coming, like Azzolini, from the 
Marche, and is said to have died young. He executed the 
monument commemorating Queen Christina's visit to the 
Capitol in 1656 (Sala dei Magistrati, Palazzo dei 
Conservatori)_a work of very poor design featuring a very 
unhappily modelled and poorly executed bust of the Queen. 
The terracotta is a work of a different order. The still life at 
the god's feet alone suggests exceptional talent.
The queen's collection was bequeathed in 1689 to Cardinal 
Azzolini, who died a few weeks afterwards, and was then sold 
(for the most part) in 1692 by his heir, Marchese Pompeo 
Azzolini, to Don Livio Odescalchi, nephew of Pope Innocent 
XI. In 1713 Odescalchi's collection was inherited by his cousin 
Baldassare d'Erba who sold the Apollo and Muses to Philip 
V of Spain in 1724. The Muses are now in the Prado in 
Madrid while the Apollo has, for over half a century, formed 
part of a fountain in the gardens of the Palace of Aranjuez. 
His rockwork seat crowns a miniature mountain of similar 
rocks cut into steps in front down which water can run into 
a basic fringed with simulated stalactitic rock. Behind the god 
is a curved screen of six Corinthian columns connecting two 
piers crowned by putti supporting bases.
The Ashmolean Museum's terracotta was acquired with an 
attribution to Michelangelo Slodtz. It was recognized as a 
bozzetto for Nocchieri's Apollo by Ian Lowe, Assistant Keeper 
in the Department, in February 1966 after he had seen a slide 
of an engraving of the latter in one of Carl Nordenfalk's Slade 
Lectures. Thanking Mr Lowe for communicating this 
discovery on 5 March Professor Nordenfalk asked that the 
terracotta be added to the list of items in the Ashmolean 
Museum which the Council of Europe were requesting for 
the exhibition on Queen Christina at the Nationalmuseum 
in Stockholm. On 9 March Mr Lowe replied that, after an 
extensive search, the terracotta could no longer be found. 
On 17 June, Luke Herrmann, another Assistant Keeper, 
reported to Nordenfalk that the terracotta had been retrieved, 
having been advertised by a `London dealer' in the English 
Art Journal. It had been stolen from the Museum. Because 
the matter was `in the hands of the police' the statuette could 
not be loaned.

Comparison with photographs of the marble statue kindly 
sent to the Museum in November 1986 by the Patrimonio 
Nacional show that there are only minor differences_in the 
marble version the lyre has an acanthus leaf ornament on its 
arms, the rockwork is of a different pattern so that the god's 
right foot is placed higher, the quiver beside his right foot is 
reversed so that, now that it is on a slope, the arrows do not 
slip out (most of the bow is missing but seems to have been 
of the same type), the posture and character of the head with 
its pronounced corymbos approximate more closely to those 
of the Apollo Belvedere, and the left hand is placed differently 
on top of the lyre. This lastmentioned difference may 
however be due to erroneous restoration, for the hand of the 
marble Apollo is missing (as are some of the fingers of his right 
hand) in the photograph kindly sent to the Museum by 
Jennifer Montagu on 9 October 1967 (`a small present from 
Spain, just in case you mislay the terracotta again'). The god's 
left hand as represented in the (admittedly not entirely 
reliable) print by Francesco Aquila, plate CXI in the Raccolta 
di statue antiche e moderne, published by Domenico de' Rossi 
in Rome in 1704, is closer to the terracotta than to the marble 
as it is today. The print also shows a plectrum in the god's 
right hand which has been restored in the marble version with 
the open gesture of the Apollo Belvedere. This plectrum would 
be an unlikely addition for Aquila to make and it is also 
mentioned by P. A. Maffei in his commentary on the plate. 
Maffei (p. 104) describes Nocchieri as a `discepolo del Cavalier 
Bernini'. He also makes the amazing claim that the Apollo is 
a portrait of the queen of Sweden_`e gli fece nel volto i 
lineamenti della medesima Reina, che veramente dir si potea 
la madre delle muse'.
A sample was taken from the figure by Mrs Doreen 
Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for 
Archaeology and the History of Art in March 1987 and 
thermoluminescence tests suggested a firing date between 
1677 and 1787 (ref. 381z95).


Possibly NOVE factory near Bassano (flourished from 1760s)
69. Hercules resting
22.2 cms. (height); 18.6 cms. (length of base excluding the 
projecting foot); 15.7 cms. (width of base)
Hardpaste porcelain. The hollow figure has been filled with cement 
to consolidate it. The glaze has been worn in the hair. The figure's 

right foot is discoloured yellow. There is a firing crack beside the 

club on the base, another in the figure's left heel, beside the lion 

skin over the base to the proper left, and another more serious, 
across the back of the base. `NON PLUS / ULTRA' is incised in the 
model on the side of the base beside the figure's right leg. There 
are two holes in the rockwork platform behind the figure. That to 
proper left is approximately one centimetre in diameter_that to 

proper right was intended to be the same size but coincides with a 
firing crack. `1971.328' is painted in red on the underside of the 
figure.

Bequeathed by W. R .B. Young in October 1971 together with a 
considerable collection of porcelain, mostly Meissen and Chelsea. 
This item was said to have come from the collection of the earl of 
Shrewsbury, Ingestre Hall. Mr Young was a retired solicitor who 
was, for some while before his death, a resident of St Cross Hospital 
, 
Winchester, a Church of England home for the destitute, from 
which he had concealed his wealth and the value of his collection_
`really only a poor jackdaw's collection', `made since the Hitler War 

out of a very small income' (letters to the Department of 27 February 

1962 and 3 February 1969).
In Mr Young's own list of his collection made on 14 
September 1968 in blue biro on blue paper this figure was 
described as `Buen Retiro' (? Capo di Monte)'. The `Buen 
Retiro' was struck out by Mr Lowe, in whose hand also the 
provenance recorded above was added (`Lord Shrewsbury'). 
Young had been a friend of George Savage, the wellknown 
ceramic expert, and the attribution may have come from him. 
There is another version of the figure in the collection of Sir 
Brinsley Ford which comes from the collection of his ancestor 
Richard Ford (1796-1858) and has an old label inscribed 
`The Famous Torso / of the Belvedere / in the Vatican / by 
Apolonius'. A third version is in the Metropolitan Museum, 
New York (Charles E. Sampson Memorial Fund, 1981.412; 
published Notable Acquisitions (1981-2), 29-30). Of this 
last version it has been observed that `the clear white hard 
paste and lustrous glaze are not those of Doccia or Cozzi; 
the presence of numerous firecracks suggests a factory not 
yet in control of work of this kind . . . It may have been made 
at Le Nove, northwest of Venice, in the little known early 
period of that factory' (entry by C. le Corbeiller in Notable 
Acquisitions cited above). This attribution is strengthened by 
the Ashmolean and Ford examples which are of different, 
darker body and have a less lustrous glaze. The treatment of 
the rockwork base and the robust classicism of the figure is 
similar to that of some of the ambitious earthenware groups 
produced by the Nove factory - such as the allegorical 
ensemble of three virtues in the Museo Civico, Bassano del 
Grappa (reproduced in J. Fleming and H. Honour, The 
Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts (London, 1977), 566). 
No explanation for the space and the holes behind Hercules 
seems to have been advanced but it might have been devised 
to enable the figure to be attached to an ensemble of precisely 
this kind. Despite the connection, made already in the early 
nineteenthcentury label on the example in the Ford 
Collection, with the Belvedere Torso (for which see No. 135) , 
the similarity is not remarkable.


Probably by Giuseppe PIAMONTINI (1664-1742)
70. and 71. Jupiter riding upon his 
eagle and Juno reposing upon the 
clouds holding her sceptre and 
peacock
44.4 cms. (height of No. 70); 46.5 cms. (height of No. 71); 17.4 
cms. (length of base of 70); 16.9 cms. (width of base of 70); 
20.2 cms. (length of base of 71); 18.5 cms. (width of base of 71)
Bronze with a chestnut brown patina, with very dark brown varnish, 
golden brown in parts and perhaps originally golden all over. 
Hollow, cast in pieces. In the case of No. 71, the clouds and, in the 

case of No. 70, the clouds and eagle are separately cast, although th 
e 
joins are almost invisible (but the right foot of Juno clearly was no 
t 
cast with the clouds below). In the case of Juno her sceptre is cast 

separately (see below), also her right forearm and her left arm at 
contact with drapery in the former case, just below it in the other. 

Jupiter's right arm is separately cast and joined just below his 
shoulder (the line is almost invisible, but is more apparent in the 
Philadelpha version). The head and torso of the Jupiter is cast 
separately from the drapery and legs. The upper portion of the body 
of Juno is cast separately from the lower part which is probably cast 

with the peacock_the join is concealed by the tail of drapery blown 
across the upper thighs. Much evidence of tooling; the hair, plumage, 

and clouds chiselled and punched.
Given by Mrs J. C. Conway in 1959. Registered on 18 December 
1959. The sceptre of Juno (`which turned up at Spring cleaning 
time') given in July 1960. Stated by the Keeper, Ian Robertson, in 
the Annual Report for 1960 to have `come from the Borghese 
Palace Collection in Rome'. The Borghese provenance must be 
considered unproven. It is given for both bronzes (nos. 87 and 91) 
and for two others (nos. 88 and 90, a Venus and Cupid and a 
Bacchus and Ariadne) in the Bardini catalogue (Catalogue des objets 
d'art provenant de la collection Bardini dont la vente aura lieu a~6 

Londres chez Mr Christie (Florence, 1899) and separate plate 
volume, pl. IV). They were sold together as lot 434, Christie's, 
London, 5-7 June 1899. The provenance was then repeated when 
the figures reappeared as `Jupiter and Juno . . . a pair of Louis XIV 

groups' lot 174 of the sale at Christie's, London, of `the Collection 

of Fine French Furniture Objects of Art and Porcelain formed by
L. Neumann Esq and removed from 11 Grosvenor Sq.' when they 
were purchased by `Clements' (code for Wertheimer) for Â£714. 
They were offered again at Christie's on 16-17 June 1920_the sale 
of `the remaining stock of French Furniture, Porcelain and Objects 
of Art of Mr Asher Wertheimer Deceased late of 158 New Bond 

Street'. Bought in by Mrs Conway's husband (who had changed his 
name from Wertheimer). The bronzes seem always to have been 
on display: at first on pedestals in the Fortnum Gallery: more recent 
ly 
in the Weldon Gallery.
The two groups were registered and recorded in the Annual 
Report as `probably the work of Michel Anguier (1612-86) 
. . . related to a considerably larger pair of firedogs in the 
Wallace Collection, which are by Anguier after Alessandro 
Algardi'. An almost identical pair of the figures in the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art (Wilstach Collection, W. 681
1 and W. 6812) were attributed to Giovanni Battista 
Foggini. The attribution to Piamontini was proposed by 
Jennifer Montagu in `Some Small Sculptures by Giuseppe 
Piamontini', Antichita~6 viva (1974), unpaginated. Piamontini 
studied under Giovanni Battista Foggini and, from 1681 until 
1686, attended the Academy founded in Rome by the Grand 
Duke Cosimo III, working under Ercole Ferrata on tomb 
sculpture, narrative reliefs, large statues of saints, and portrait 
busts. According to his own account, groups and statues of 
marble and bronze by him were sent (presumably from 
Florence) `in Roma, Bolognia, Prussia, Londra, al Reno,
e Scozzia, e Inghilterra' (Autobiographical note printed in
K. Lankheit, Florentinische Barockplastik (Munich, 1962),
doc. 46, p. 232).
Montagu noted that among the models in the inventory 
made for the Doccia ceramic factory established in 1743 by 
Senator Carlo Ginori were three attributed to Piamontini: a 
`Giove con Aquila, sulla base', corresponding, she proposed, 
with the polychromed porcelain figure in the Museo Civico, 
Turin (her fig. 4), and an `altro Giove piu piccolo sedente 
sull`Aquila' together with a `Giunone', which, she proposed, 
correspond with the bronzes in the Ashmolean. A Jupiter 
group is also mentioned among Piamontini's models by 
Baldinucci. A version of the bronze group on a wall bracket 
is to be seen in Thomas Patch's painting of a party of dilettanti 
at the home of Sir Horace Mann (Chatsworth, Derbyshire). 
Ceramic versions would presumably have served a similar 
purpose, but the bronzes probably originated as ornaments 
for firedogs (Jupiter with his thunderbolt representing the 
flames, and Juno the air which a good fire requires), and 
were certainly inspired by groups modelled by Algardi for this 
purpose. The suggestion that the bronzes might be made in 
France is also understandable since Parisian founders were to 
become masters at joining bronzes cast in numerous pieces 
(see No. 341), a task which is accomplished so skilfully here. 
This method of construction is also characteristic of 
Florentine foundries, for example, in the bronze versions of 
Massimiliano Soldani's groups and reliefs which are likely to 
be of the same date as Piamontini's. Soldani's bronzes are also 
similarly sharply chiselled and punched. Whether Piamontini 
would have directed the casting and participated in the 
finishing of his bronze is uncertain, but not unlikely given 
the practice of other Florentine sculptors of this period.

The only differences between the groups in Oxford and 
Philadelphia, apart from the loss of the sceptre in the 
Philadelphia Juno group, and the defective crest on the 
peacock in the Oxford Juno group, are minute ones in the 
pattern of the tooling_joins and solder smear are also more 
easily seen in the Philadelphia groups partly because metal 
and varnish are less dark.


PIERINO DA VINCI (1530-53)
72. Ugolino, imprisoned by the 
Arno, with his sons and grandsons, 
visited by Famine
62 cms. (height); 45 cms. (width); see also below
White wax discoloured to a yellow cream colour. The reverse is 
partly hollowed: the hollows corresponding to the highest relief on 
the side viewed. This reveals that the wax was cast; but it was also 

extensively modelled, for many details, most notably the fingers of 
Arno's left hand on his urn or those of the right hand of the seated 

youth whose knees touch the lefthand border of the composition, 
are completely undercut, and the entire surface has been sharply 
tooled, as is clear on close inspection in a good light and still mor 
e 
so under magnification. There is a network of cracks on the left
hand side of the relief: from the left elbow of the personification o 
f 
Famine to the right shoulder of the seated youth already referred 
to, across the left knee of the other seated youth behind him, and 
(very fine) along the left thigh of the reclining youth; across the 
rocky river bank and river in the lower left corner; across the left 
foot 
of Ugolino. The fingers, excepting the index finger, of Arno's left 
hand have been broken off and refixed. Incised on the rocky river 
bank: `DANTE XXXIII INFERNO'. Some spoonings of wax have been 
removed from the reverse of the relief perhaps to serve, reworked, 
as cement for repairs_a more recent (cleaner coloured) wax is 
apparent along the major cracks. The irregularly rectangular relief 
is fixed into an old wooden frame with cement and old handmade 
nails. The front of the wax is cut back within its rough edges to a 
sharp edge forming an approximate rectangle of the dimensions 
given above. The relief is mounted in a heavy glazed walnut frame 
with partially gilt egg and dart mouldings probably made by the 
Museum in the 1940s (see No. 55). A letter from Arthur Evans to 
Fortnum of 5 November 1897 mentions that `its dirt was dreadful 
but I suggested a gentle application of soda & water which has had 
most successful results'.
Deposited in the Ashmolean Museum by the Radcliffe Trustees in 
1897; presented to the University of Oxford in 1841 by Philip
B. Duncan, Keeper of the Ashmolean, to whom it had been 
presented by his friend Prince Hoare (1755-1834), the artist, who 
had inherited it from William Hoare (1706-92), who may have 
acquired it from Henry Trench. `Mr Trent a painter' is said in John 

Breval's Remarks on Several Parts of Europe of 1738 to have bought 
this `noble Basrelief ' over to England `some years ago'_this was, 

apparently, shortly before 1719 when Jonathan Richardson the Elder 
published his Discourse on the Dignity, Certainty, Pleasure and 
Advantage of the Science of Connoisseurship in which (pp. 32-3) he 
mentions the relief as in the hands of `Mr Trench, a Modest, 
Ingenious Painter, lately arriv'd from his long Studies in Italy'. (T 
he 
only problem with this provenance, apart from any firm evidence of 
where Hoare acquired it, is that neither Breval nor Richardson 
specify that Trench's relief is of wax.)
Vasari described how Pierino, the nephew of Leonardo da 
Vinci, studied with Bandinelli and then with Tribolo, by 
whom he was recognized as a prodigy, and how Luca Martini, 
a scholarly nobleman and one of Duke Cosimo's leading 
courtiers, made him his protÃ©gÃ©. Martini commissioned a 
marble relief of Christ at the Column when Pierino was less 
than 17 (114~^V23 braccia, possibly to be identified with the 
rather smaller but obviously cutdown oval Flagellation relief 
at the Nelson Atkins Museum, Kansas City, 51-3, generally 
regarded as by Vincenzo Danti). Martini also introduced 
Pierino to Francesco Bandini who took him to Rome where 
he enjoyed great success (and made, among much else, a wax 
copy of Michelangelo's Moses as a present for Martini). Then 
he summoned him to Pisa, of which city Cosimo had made 
him provveditore in 1547, and gave him several commissions 
there. Of the latter commissions the most private one, an 
idea of Pierino's own but reflecting Martini's scholarly 
commentary on Dante, and his interest in Pisa, was a relief 
illustrating the fate, in a Pisan prison, of the Florentine Count 
Ugolino della Gherardesca recounted by Dante in the thirty
third Canto of the Inferno. Vasari describes this work at 
length, mentioning also that Pierino began work on it at the 
same time that he carved the river god now in the Louvre 
presented by Martini to the Duchess Eleonora (who 
presented it to her brother). The relief must date from after 
15 October 1548 when, as Jonathan Nelson has pointed out 
to me, Martini borrowed an ancient manuscript version of 
Dante and commenced his annotations.
Vasari specifies that the model was in wax and was 
subsequently cast in bronze to the delight of his patron. 
Whether the casting was managed by Pierino himself may be 
doubted (Vasari records that the children Pierino had 
modelled for the rim of the Hercules fountain by Tribolo at 
the Medici Villa at Castello had been cast by Zanobi 
Lastricati). The emphasis placed on the wax model by Vasari 
suggests that it was valued in its own right and also that such 
a model survived the casting process. If the original wax model 
was the one employed in the casting then it would of course 
have been lost in the process, but it seems most unlikely that 
the sculptor would not have retained a replica of this original 
wax model, not least as a precaution against a foundry 
accident. Such a replica would perhaps have been worked up 

from an approximate cast made after the first model; and that 
is exactly what this wax would seem to be. This hypothesis 
would be supported by the survival of other wax models 
preparatory to bronze reliefs of this period, and one does not 
have to look far to find examples: the models in red wax 
(Victoria and Albert Museum, 328, 329, 3301879) for the 
reliefs in the Grimaldi Chapel of S. Franceso di Castelletto in 
Genoa commissioned from Giambologna in the late 1570s 
are as highly finished as this relief (although in less good 
condition), but cannot be reproductions of the bronzes since 
they differ from them in minor respects. On the other hand 
wax reliefs were also cast for collectors as alternatives to casts 
in terracotta, reproducing popular works also available in 
bronze or precious metal. The export of such casts in red, 
black, and white wax is mentioned as an important part of 
the sculptor's business in the litigation concerning Cobbert's 
models in Rome in 1609 (A. Bertolotti, Artisti lombardi a 
Roma (Milan, 1881), ii. 123-61). If this wax does not come 
into this category then the only other explanation for its 
existence is that it was prepared for casting in bronze. This 
would incidentally explain the hollowed reverse, designed to 
avoid uneven thickness and consequent strain in cooling. This 
is what Fortnum believed it to be (letter to Arthur Evans of 
12 December 1897).
Even if this wax is made after the bronze, however, it has 
been finished with quite extraordinary care. When examined 
closely, and especially under magnification, every detail has 
been tooled and the undercutting is formidable. It has 
sometimes been described as a later cast, or even as an 
aftercast, by careless scholars, or by dealers. Many of the 
latter and some of the former have made large claims for the 
other surviving versions of the relief in terracotta, gesso, and 
marble, which, however, all omit or slur details included with 
crisp clarity in the wax_none of them, for example, includes 
the long, very low relief, fingernail of the pointing hand of 
Famine; they all either exclude or confuse the lion's head 
peeping out beside Arno's urn; and, perhaps most 
significantly, none of them includes any of the undercutting. 
Furthermore, when details are measured it will be found that 
all these other reliefs are considerably smaller, as would be 
expected if they were cast from moulds made after the original 
bronze, or, in the case of the marble versions, copied from 
models made in this way, for bronze and terracotta both 
contract when cooling.
Of the other versions in terracotta one is in the Ashmolean 
Museum (No. 73) and the other has long been in the collection 
of the Gherardesca family (that is Ugolino's family) in 
Florence. The latter was exhibited at the Mostre dei tesori 
segreti delle case fiorentine in Florence, June-July 1960 (no. 
172, pp. 71 and 118 in the catalogue). The relief was engraved 
as early as 1782 (see F. Yates, `Transformations of Dante's 
Ugolino', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 
(1951), pl. 17b). This print is interesting in that it extends 
the composition to clarify the fact that the figures are on an 

island in the Arno. The Gheradesca relief is illustrated, 
together with what appears to be its sixteenthcentury frame, 
in Pantheon (1960), 18, p. cxix. Although superior claims 
have been made for the Gherardesca version, which has 
sometimes even been described as the original bronze, it is 
little different from the Ashmolean's terracotta (which also 
has a Florentine provenance), and is no more sharp in its 
details. It seems also to be the same size. In the wax version 
the foot of the Arno is 6.85 cms. in length but in the 
Ashmolean's terracotta it is 6.5 cms. In the wax the distance 
between the left shoulder of the youth with his back to us 
and the uppermost part of Ugolino's left arm is 42.35 cms., 
whereas it is 41.3 cms. in the Ashmolean's terracotta.
The plaster or gesso versions appear to have been cast after 
these terracottas. One such was lot 36 in the sale at Christie's 
on 3 July 1823 of the studio of Nollekens. One, which is very 
coarse, is in the Bargello (`mentioned by some German 
authorities to be an original marble', C. F. Bell notes in the 
margin of Fortnum's large manuscript catalogue). Another, 
rather better in quality, belonged to Michael Hall Fine Arts, 
6 East 79th Street, New York, in March 1969 (when 
advertised in the Burlington Magazine, p. cxvii). Most bronze 
casts also look like aftercasts_one was in a private collection 
in Cheltenham in September 1976 when it was taken to the 
Museum_in this version Arno and the reclining youth's 
genitalia were concealed by bullrushes or drapery; another of 
this character was sold at Christie's, 9 July 1979, lot 90, as 
`A north Italian bronze plaque of an allegorical scene after 
Pietro da Barga'. The one exception, which will be considered 
separately below, is the cast in the collection of the duke of 
Devonshire which Charles Avery was the first to propose as 
possibly the original.
A marble version, acquired by a New York dealer at auction 
in New York in 1987, is a work of some quality. It includes 
the teeth of Famine, although not those in the mouth of the 
desperate youth nearest to Ugolino, but does not attempt 
the undercutting of the fingers, and does not possess, in the 
treatment of the waves of the Arno or the curls of hair, a 
plasticity that matches that in the wax version. There are also 
minor differences tending to simplify the details_the reeds 
by the river side are not clearly reeds for instance and are 
excluded from the hair of Arno.
The relief was sometimes attributed, in the eighteenth and 
even nineteenth century, to Michelangelo and Prince Hoare 
retained this attribution. The Richardsons evidently 
entertained doubts about this when they published the French 
edition of their Works (TraitÃ© de la peinture (Amsterdam, 
1728), ii. 138-40). Bottari was also to do so in his edition 
of Vasari of 1759-60 (iii. 354) as was Charles Rogers in his 
translation of the Inferno of 1782 (pp. 128-9).
The disagreeable drawing purporting to be a preparatory 
idea for the relief which was purchased by the Ashmolean
in 1963 (Sotheby's, London, 12 March 1963, lot 18) is
hardly of a quality one would expect from Pierino.

However, it, and another drawing of similar character, are
curious in that they come closer to Vasari's description of
the relief than the relief itself does (an observation I owe to
Charles Avery).
It remains to consider the bronze version at Chatsworth. 
This is set with lead into pedestal no. 99a. This pedestal, 
which is of oval plan, now supports the colossal bust of the 
Emperor Napoleon by Canova, but in the inventory of 1905 
it is described as supporting the Greyhound and Puppies by 
Joseph Gott and it was clearly designed to do so. Gott's 
sculpture was one of the marbles which arrived at Chatsworth 
from Rome in 1825 and the pedestal is likely to have been 
made soon afterwards. It is of local stone in common with 
several others into which the 6th duke, characteristically, had 
miscellaneous pieces of coloured marble, and even in one case 
some antique coins, embedded. The duke does not mention 
the bronze relief in his own description of his collection which 
suggests that he set little store by it, and perhaps he did not 
buy it himself. If he did inherit it, then it is quite likely to 
have come, along with much else at Chatsworth, from the 
collection of Lord Burlington. It is interesting in this 
connection that Trench, who is credited with importing the 
relief of Ugolino into Britain_in accounts which do not 
describe it as a wax_ was a protÃ©gÃ© of Burlington. Vertue 
records that he came from Rome, where he had studied with 
Chiari, to London but enjoyed no success as a history painter 
and so went again to Italy for several years, returning to 
London in October 1725 (`The Vertue Notebooks', iii, 
Walpole Society, 20 (1933-4), 25.) The account suggests that 
he was likely to sell what he had collected, and if so Burlington 
would have been likely to buy it.
This bronze is 65 cms. high (but the topmost edge is 
embedded in the stone slot in which it is set) and 46.5 cms. 
wide. It extends further to all sides than any other version, 
especially along the top where there are two holes presumably 
for attaching it which have been plugged. There is a bad 
casting flaw in the waves on the lower border of the relief to 
proper right which must once have been filled with wax. 
Although it has been impossible to inspect the rear of the 
bronze the character of this flaw suggests that this is a lost
wax cast. Every detail found in the Ashmolean's wax is also 
found here_including the lettering on the rocky bank, the 
lion's head in the lower right corner, the sharpedged reeds 
flowing over the biceps of Arno, the fingernails of Famine. 
Arno's left hand is not undercut but it is in the same attitude. 
It is hard to consider this as anything other than Pierino's 
original. The measurement of Arno's foot is the same as in 
the wax; other measurements are a little larger in some cases 
and smaller in others. This does not clarify its relationship 
with the wax, but clearly both it and the wax are to be 
distinguished in size as well as quality from all other known 
versions. Charles Avery has proposed to me that the wax was 
perhaps cast in the eighteenth century from the Chatsworth 
bronze but that does not explain why some details (most 

notably Arno's left hand) are finer in the wax.

After PIERINO DA VINCI (1530-53)
73. Ugolino, imprisoned by the 
Arno, with his sons and grandsons, 
visited by Famine

61 cms. (height); 45 cms. (width)
Terracotta of a grey red colour. Cast, but with some lines tooled 
before the clay was fired_e.g. in the contour of the reclining youth. 

There is a chip on Ugolino's left knee. The relief has been broken 
into three parts: a rough line, passing under Ugolino's right arm 
and over the head of the youth beside him which then divides to 
pass up to the pointing hand of Famine and down to the upper 
chest of the prominent seated youth and to the back of the youth 
behind him, indicates the repair; there is a certain amount of fillin 
g 
and applied colour at points on this line. `S.28.' is written in blac 
k 
ink on the rocks in the lower left corner. There is a seal with arms 

and coronet on the reverse.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888, given by him later 
in the same year. S. 28 in his catalogues. Purchased by him in 
Florence in the winter of 1864-5 for Â£12. `For many years in the 
house of a Del Agata in Via Ghibellina' in Florence.
See No. 72.



Unknown founder

Probably after PIERINO DA VINCI (1530-53)
74. Male nude probably intended 
for Adam tempted
17 cms. (height); 9.5 cms. (height of pedestal); 8.4 cms. (width 
and length of pedestal)
Bronze with a pale green to grey brown natural patina darkened in 
the hollows, covered with a warm golden translucent lacquer 
preserved in many areas. Hollow, lostwax, cast. The surface covered 

with very fine wirebrushed lines following the contours except on 
the figure's right forearm where a fine joint may just be perceived: 

this part was evidently separately cast and given the lack of continu 
ity 
of finish was doubtless a later replacement. There is a small firing 

crack in the bicep of the figure's left arm. Plugs (presumably 
replacing holes made by chaplets) can be detected above the figure's 

right arm, also above his left knee where there is a very slight crac 
k. 

The figure is mounted on a moulded pedestal, square in plan, of 
mahogany veneer of three tones, the recessed panels and mouldings 
darkest. The lighter, golden wood matches the lacquer of the bronze. 

` 421' is painted in black.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. Given later in the 
same year. B. 421 in his catalogues `Bought in London' (according 
to his large manuscript catalogue), but more precisely `Bought at 
Christie' (according to his earlier notebook catalogue), presumably 
after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not 
included, was compiled.
A
Fortnum speculated that this `nude man walking and in 
anxious attitude' might be intended as Adam. Certainly the 
figure seems to be responding to another as in numerous 
instances of paired nudes, representing Adam and Eve at the 
moment of their temptation or, more commonly, of his 
temptation, in prints and statuettes of bronze and boxwood, 
produced in the first half of the sixteenth century north of the 
Alps_the pair of bronze figures attributed to Leonhard 
Magt, lot 32 at Sotheby's, London, 10 December 1987; the 
pair of boxwood figures attributed to Conrad Meit in the 
Kunsthistoriches Museum, Vienna (295; 9888/9); the pair 
of boxwood figures attributed to Christoph Weidith in the 
same museum (317; 3965 and 3967); or those attributed to 
Daniel Mauch in the Cleveland Museum of Art (46.429 and 
46.491), are good examples of the statuettes. Such groups 
were also found in Italy at least in the second half of the 
century in bronze (see W. Bode, Italian Bronze Statuettes of 
the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii. 23-4, pl. CLX; ii. 20, 
pl. CXLVIII; iii. 23, pl. CCLVII), and there was also the 
marble group of Adam and Eve made by Bandinelli in 1551 
for the Duomo in Florence (Museo Nazionale, Florence).
The sculptor is more difficult to guess than the subject. 
Fortnum catalogues the figure as `the work probably of a 
goldsmith sculptor of the later XVI century, a follower of the 
schools of Gio: di Bologna or of Ben0 Cellini'. Bell however 
recorded in the margin of the large catalogue that Bode 
suggested that it was French. Ian Robertson later wrote there 
that the figure was `probably by Hubert Gerhard'. A northern 
European artist has generally been suggested since then, 
perhaps because of the beard which compares very closely, for 
example, with that given to Adam by Zacharias Hegewald in 
his marble group of 1630-1 (destroyed 1945 but reproduced 
J. Rasmussen, Barockplastik in Norddeutschland (Museum 
fu~8r Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg, 1977), 46), and also 
because its extreme precision and beauty of surface are 
characteristic of documented German court goldsmiths. Hans 
Weihrauch suggested that it is by a Netherlandish goldsmith 
and of c.1600 (Europa~8ische Bronzestatuetten (Brunswick, 
1967), 363, pl. 439).
There seems, however, no reason why the statuette should 
not be, as Fortnum proposed, Italian. Although ideal nude 
figures were less likely to be influenced in Italy by modern 

fashions in facial hair, the beard here is not unlike that which 
Bandinelli gave to his Adam. There is also plenty of evidence 
that exquisite and miniature work was made by Italian 
goldsmiths even if names and works can seldom be matched. 
The golden varnish employed on this figure is also known to 
have been popular in Florence in the late sixteenth century. 
If we search for other sixteenthcentury statuettes which are 
of comparable size and finish, two, with an Italian provenance, 
present themselves: the Bacchus and the Pomona (or Venus) 
in the Ca d'Oro in Venice (nos. 58 and 59). Not only is the 
size the same_exactly the same in the case of the Venus or 
Pomona_but this size is a most unusual one, so a coincidence 
is improbable. Furthermore the type of varnish and the 
distinctive wirebrush finish is identical. The style is very close: 

the treatment of facial features, details such as fingernails and 
hair on the Adam and the Venus or Pomona are the same. 
Furthermore the quality is the same: the Adam and the Venus 
or Pomona are among the most beautiful small bronzes to 
have survived from the sixteenth century.
It has recently been demonstrated by Peter Meller (`Un 
gruppo di bronzetti di Pierino da Vinci del 1547', 
Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Instituts in Florenz, 18 
(1974), 251-72) that the two bronzes in the Ca d'Oro were 
originally fixed to a handsome bronze base (no. 60) in the 
same collection decorated with the Stemma of the Martini 
family (to which Pierino's chief patron belonged) upon which 
is chiselled the date `M~^@D~^@XL~^@VII' (1547) and `OPERA ~^@ DI ~^@ 

PIERO ~^@ DA ~^@ VINCI.' It may seem hard to understand how a 
figure supposed to represent Adam can have any relation 
with these pagan figures, but the Pomona looks very much 
like an Eve, as Meller, with no knowledge of a possible 
partner in Oxford, astutely observed_and he even speculated 
that Pierino might originally have thought of creating an 
Adam and Eve group (ibid. 259-62 and n. 19). When the 
Adam is seen, or rather imagined, beside the Ca d'Oro female 
nude the relationship has indeed far more interest, formally 
and as narrative, than that which exists in the pagan grouping. 
The Bacchus exists in only one other version (formerly in 
Berlin_see Meller, op. cit. 263) but the female bronze 
statuette exists in two other versions, one in the Louvre 
(Donation Thiers no. 87) and one formerly in the Benda 
Collection in Vienna (Bode, op. cit., ii, pl. CL, p. 20), and 
one of these could have originally been the Eve for the 
Ashmolean's Adam. The Louvre bronze retains exactly the 
same finely scratched surface and colour both of varnish and 
of natural patina as the Ashmolean's figure. That a sculptor 
in this period could have sanctioned the change of a work 
originally conceived as Eve into a Venus or Pomona (or vice 
versa) need not surprise us: Alessandro Vittoria in a will dated 
7 November 1570 made special mention of `La mia statua di 
bronzo' which could serve as a Sebastian or a Marsyas 
according to taste (G. Gerola, `Nuovi documenti veneziani 

su Alessandro Vittoria', Atti del Real Istituto Veneto di 
Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, 84 (1924-5), 348).
There is one other bronze statuette which might be related 
to this group by Pierino; it is a female nude in the reserve 
collection of the Art Institute of Chicago (19641159)_a 
figure of mysterious identity, described as a Lucretia and 
holding open a wound in her breast. This is very similar in 
character to the Ca d'Oro female although less well preserved 
in its surface. It is 7.4 cms. high, but this includes an integral 
base and if that is excluded the size is 17.1 cms._nearly 
identical. It is also possible to imagine her serving as a 
companion for the Ashmolean Museum Adam. It should 
also be pointed out that the remarkable pair of polychrome 
wooden statuettes representing Epimetes and Pandora by El 
Greco (Prado, Madrid) must have been derived from the 
Ashmolean male nude and the Ca d'Oro female one, and 
were indeed once supposed to be of Adam and Eve (Conde 
de las Infantas, `Dos esculturas del Greco', Archivio espan~;ol 
de arte, 18 (1945), 193-200).
The inscription on the bronze base in the Ca d'Oro should 
not be taken as proof that Pierino was responsible for the 
casting or even finishing of the bronze figures once attached 
to it. There are certainly cases of such names placed boldly on 
bronzes which are known to have been cast by independent 
craftsmen (Bandinelli, one of Pierino's masters, is a case in 
point). Vasari mentions that the children which Pierino 
modelled for the rim of the Hercules fountain by Tribolo at 
the Medici Villa at Castello had been cast by Zanobi Lastricati, 
and it would seem likely that he was dependent upon specialist 
founders and goldsmiths for the execution of subsequent 
work in this medium. The only other surviving bronze which 
has been convincingly attributed to him is the candlestick
in the form of a miniature tripod in the British Museum
(U. Middeldorf, `Notes on Italian Bronzes', Burlington 
Magazine (Dec. 1938), 204-9) the finish of which is not very 
close to that of the Ca d'Oro figures.
Finally, it must be asked how the Adam fits into Pierino's 
\~uvre. The answer has to be that one would never have 
guessed that it was by him, any more than one would have 
guessed that the female nude or the Bacchus in the Ca d'Oro 
were by him. Comparisons, for example between the hair of 
the Adam and that of the youths in the Ugolino relief (No. 
72) or of the River God in the Louvre, can be made which 
reduce one's surprise, but one aspect of the figure remains 
unexpected_the alert, nervous tension and arrested 
movement which depends upon the figure's unbent right leg. 
Pierino in his other works consistently avoided giving figures 
an erect posture and had indeed an unusual preference for 
sagging poses.
Peter Meller, who accepts that the Adam must have been 
made as a companion with the Eve/Pomona, has proposed 
to me that it might be the work of the same, surely 
Netherlandish, artist who created the exquisite statuette of St 
John (presumably from a Crucifixion group) in the Bargello, 

Florence (Inv. 741). Also striking is the relationship with the 
battered and highly restored Adam by Stoldo Lorenzi in the 
Castello Sforzesco, Milan (038).


Bartolomeo PINELLI (1781-1835)
75. Man baiting a bull with mastiffs
35 cms. (height, approximate because the base is sunk in the 
wooden plinth); 41 cms. (length of rough integral oval base); 
45.8 cms. (length of wooden plinth); 38.1 cms. (width of wooden 
plinth)
Terracotta of a pale cream to greypink colour. Numerous minor 
firing cracks but few chips missing. The end of the bull's right horn 

is missing. There is an old repair where the man's hand grips the 
forehead of the bull. The back legs of the bull have been broken 
and recently repaired. `Pinelli fece 1827' is incised boldly and 
cursively on the rim of the rough integral oval base; the `2' is easi 
ly 
mistaken for an `0'. The group is mounted on a plinth of pale beech.
Given by Mrs Harvey in 1910 from the collection of her husband 
the late H. A. Harvey of Christ Church. The recent repairs were 
carried out by Mr Saleh in the 1970s.
Pinelli seems always to have modelled on a small scale in clay, 
picking up the art from his father, an impoverished maker of 
cheap devotional images; but his terracottas only attracted 
attention from the public, and perhaps only received serious 
attention from him, after his drawings and prints came into 
great demand in the years following the successful publication 
1809 of his etchings of the picturesque costumes of the 
Campagna. His earliest dated terracotta is of 1812, and most 
of his surviving works are dated between 1828 and 1835. In 
1834 he published etchings of some of them under the title 
`Gruppi pittoreschi modellati in terracotta da Bartolomeo 
PINELLI ed incisi all'acquaforte da lui medesimo', consisting 
of a frontispiece and twenty plates. An additional eight plates 
were added to the series in 1835. The subjects tend to be 
carnival Piferrari, the Saltarello, Brigands, or simply 
Contadine with their children (see G. Incisa della Rocchetta, 
Bartolomeo Pinelli (Palazzo Braschi, Rome, 1956)_a 
catalogue of twentytwo signed sculptures all from Roman 
collections which also includes an edition of the biography of 
Pinelli by Oreste Raggi). The Ashmolean's group is typical 
of a heroic tendency in Pinelli's treatment of traditional 
popular activity which recalls some of the studies GÃ©ricault 
had made ten years previously in Rome. It makes Pinelli's 
relatively rare treatments of classical subjectmatter easier to 
understand. (For this latter aspect of his art see the gilded 
terracottas of Jupiter and Juno dated 1815, published by
A. Gonza~5lezPalacios (Il tempio del gusto (Roma e il regno
delle Due Sicilie) (Milan, 1984), i. 179), and for Pinelli's neo
classicism generally see id., `La grammatica neoclassica', in
Antichita~6 viva (Sept. 1973), and M. Fagiolo and M. Marini,
Bartolomeo Pinelli 1781-1835 e il suo tempo (Rome, 1983),

102-6, for the watercolours and line drawings of `Episodi
della storia Greca' dated 1820-1, and 141 for his treatment
of the Niobids.)


Imitator of Angelo Gabriello PIO (1690-1770)
76. Virgin and Child
25.9 cms. (height); 20.8 cms. (width); 1.4 cms. (thickness of 
relief); 20.5 cms. (height of pedestal); 24.3 cms. (length of 
pedestal); 13.8 cms. (width of pedestal)
Terracotta of a pale pink colour. Old colouring seems to have been 
removed upon acquisition, but traces of blue and white pigment 
remain in the hollows of the drapery. There are also traces of gilding 
around the edges of the ground, possibly from a frame. There is a 
crack passing through the entire relief to proper left of centre, most 
evident across the back of the Virgin's hand. There is another crack 
in the ground to proper right, also small losses from the edges of 
the drapery and numerous tiny cracks and scratches. There is an 
irregular edge cut back all around the relief for the rebate of a fra 
me. 
This looks as if it has been cut out of the relief after firing. The 
relief was apparently mounted on a velvetcovered plinth and 
surround shortly before acquisition but this was probably replaced 
because the dark green velvet is one much used by the Museum. 
The pedestal of gilded wood with rather coarse foliate Cscrolls 
against a field of bluegrey colour is likely to have been supplied by 
the dealer.
Bought with the aid of the Blakiston Fund from Messrs. P. & D. 
Colnaghi, Old Bond Street, London, in 1964. The purchase was 
discussed by the Keeper, Ian Robertson, in a letter to Roddy Thesiger 
of Colnaghi's on 27 February 1964. Robertson agreed to make the 
first half payment in April. He was keen that the relief should be 
included in the gallery's spring exhibition Paintings by Old Masters 

where it was no. 8 (illustrated as pl. VI in the catalogue). The relief 
was registered on 10 June.
The relief was acquired with an attribution to Giuseppe Mazza 
and Robertson published it in the Annual Report as âof about 
1700, and perhaps executed during the artist's visit to Venice'. 
He added that âit offers features of handling comparable with 
the initialled oval relief of the same subject formerly in the 
Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin' (reproduced in A. E. 
Brinckmann, BarockBozzetti (Berlin, 1923), i. 150, pl. 66). 
There are similarities with the terracotta reliefs signed âG.M.' 
which are attributed to Mazza, but there is no very close 
connection with the relief Robertson singled out, and his 
precision of dating was overconfident. There were other 

sculptors from Bologna working in terracotta in this style and 
on this scale among whom the sculptor who succeeded Mazza 
as the leading artist in terracotta and stucco there, Angelo 
Gabriello Pio (1690-1770), seems worthy of consideration in 
connection with this relief. (For Mazza see E. Ricco~6mini, 
Ordine e vaghezza: Scultura in Emilia nell'eta~6 barocca 
(Bologna, 1972), 90-115 and elsewhere, and for Pio~6, id., 
Vaghezza e furore: La scultura del settecento in Emila 
(Bologna, 1977), 50-69.) The curvaceous eyelids of the 
Virgin, her slightly pointed nose, the flat ends of her tapering 
fingers, and the very small mouth of the Christ Child are all 
idiosyncrasies to be observed in Pio, although in less marked 
form. The work does not, however, seem quite good enough 
to be by him.
The highly attractive handling of the drapery, its softness 
of texture combining with the infantile and feminine flesh 
with which its continuous flutter contrasts, conceals only 
briefly the uncertain management of the planes - the flatness 
of the Virgin's right arm and the uncomfortably abrupt 
foreshortening of her left arm. Also unsatisfactory is the 
uncertain direction of the Virgin's gaze and the tight and 
truncated character of the composition, especially where her 
left arm is cut off and the drapery stops below the arms. 
However, if, as there is reason to suspect, the relief was cut 
down, then we would originally have understood whether she 
was sitting or standing, a St John or a donor would have 
made sense of her gaze, and the composition would appear 
less cramped. Most intimate devotional reliefs of this type 
made in Bologna were oval.
Samples were taken by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the 
Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History 
of Art in April 1974 and a thermoluminescence test indicated 
that the relief was fired between 1583 and 1788 (ref. 81m
63). Another sample taken in October 1986 indicated that 
it was fired between 1606 and 1736 (ref. 381y37).

Lorenzo Cardelli (active 1770-1810)

After designs by Giovanni Battista PIRANESI (1720-78)
77 and 78. Pair of candelabra, one 
involving three cranes and a 
kneeling faun (77) and the other 
three elephant heads and an altar 
decorated with reliefs of deities (78), 
both supported by three lion's legs
244.1 cms. (height of No. 77, excluding marble pedestal); 243.9 
cms. (height of No. 78, excluding marble pedestal); 41 cms. 
(height of each marble pedestal); 44.5 cms. (diameter of the 
acanthus cup crowning each candelabrum); 68.5 cms. (height of 
the cranes in 77).
White marble, of a variety of types, with much of the surface abraded 
. 
Each candelabrum is composed of numerous parts and iron has 
been used extensively in assembling them. In some areas the rusting 

cramps are evident on the surface, e.g. in the tail of the crane 
standing below the faun's tail in No. 77, in one corner of the altar 

stage in No. 78, and on the plinth between paws of the lions and 
the central support in No. 78. The question of which parts of the 
candelabra are ancient is discussed below. Piranesi was capable of 
breaking and rejoining the modern work to make it look ancient 
which complicates this discussion, but there has also been accidenta 
l 
damage (and perhaps vandalism) since the candelabra arrived in 
Oxford. The breaks in the legs of the cranes, for instance, are 
relatively recent, to judge by the modern adhesive all too evident on 

them. It is interesting that there were originally two struts between 

each pair of crane legs_struts left by the restorer to improve the 
sculpture's chances of surviving unbroken in transport. These should 

have been carefully cut away by a mason when the candelabra were 
erected in the Radcliffe Camera. One remains; the others have been 
knocked off, leaving little branches on the legs. The stage of No. 77 

which consists of a relief of masks framed by eagles has been pitted 

all over perhaps as an attempt at `distressing'. The upper surface of 

the plinth of No. 77 has been very coarsely tooled and what looks 
like a letter `a' and certainly a letter `b' have been crudely chisel 
led 
on it. The points of the beaks of all the cranes and the ends of the 

trunks of two of the three elephants have been broken off and lost. 
Both unmoulded marble pedestals are chiselled with the following 
text, blacked for emphasis: `ACADEMIAE. OXONIENSI / HOC /

The candelbra were bought in Rome on 6 May 1775 by Sir Roger 
Newdigate from Piranesi for 1,000 Roman scudi, shipped to 
London through the agency of Thomas Jenkins, who also acted as 
Newdigate's banker, in the same year, and presented to the 
University in the following year, as declared by the Latin inscriptio 
ns. 
A bill for minor restoration, for transport, for the pedestals (in pl 
ain 
marble, unmoulded, following the line of the plinths), and for the 
inscription on the latter was submitted on 21 December 1776 by 
the London sculptor Richard Hayward. The candelabra were 
certainly installed in the Radcliffe library by February 1777. (See 
M. McCarthy, `Sir Roger Newdigate and Piranesi', Burlington 
Magazine (July 1972), 466-72). The position of the candelabra 
within the Radcliffe Camera against the piers of the great reading 
room may be seen in R. Ackermann's History of Oxford, ii, (London, 

1814), 238. In F. Mackenzie's drawing (engraved in 1836 for the 
Oxford Almanack) they are shown surrounded by casts of the Apollo 
Belvedere, the Diane chasseresse, the Stooping Discobolus, the Laocoo 
~8n, 
and the Wrestlers. According to all recent published accounts the 
candelabra were transferred to the University Galleries in 1846, but 

Michaelis recorded them as still `said to be' in the Radcliffe librar 
y 
where he did not have time to examine them (Ancient Marbles in 
Great Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 593-4) and they were in fact 
transferred in 1894 and were probably immediately set up in the 
Randolph Gallery where they were certainly to be seen in 1909 
(Summary Guide, 17) and where they have remained since, although 
in different positions. Their position at the eastern end of the gall 
ery 
was taken up in 1983. They were moved to the entrance of the 
Ruskin lecture hall in 1991.
Having established himself by the early 1750s as the leading 
topographical printmaker in Rome, Piranesi moved into the 
field of archaeological illustration with this Trofei di Ottaviano 
Augusto of 1755 and the four volumes of the Antichita~6 
romane of 1756. Such work entailed a close study of the loose 
fragments of architectural ornament as well as the halfburied 
bones of buildings. His interest in such fragments must have 
increased during the mid1760s when he was invited to 
employ and invent such ornaments himself, serving his fellow 
Venetian Pope Clement XIII (Rezzonico) as architect and 
designer of furniture and dÃ©cor. And in the same years he 
became more interested in architectural theory, publishing in 
his Parere su l'architettura of 1765 a boldly polemical defence 
of the licence of Roman architectural practice, which was 
based on a thorough study of the originality and fantasy of 
ancient Roman ornamental sculpture. By 1767 Piranesi was 
certainly busy with the design (and in supervising the 
manufacture) of chimneypieces in which fragments of ancient 
relief carving and even portions of ancient architraves were 
sometimes incorporated, so he must have begun to collect 
antiquities by then and had probably already begun to form 
`a museum specially devoted to fragments of architecture and 
a collection of ornaments unique in its kind', as it was 
described by his biographer J. G. Legrand (`Notice historique 
sur la vie et les ouvrages de J. B. Piranesi' (1801), first 
reprinted in Nouvelles de l'estampe, 5 (1969), and 
subsequently fully edited by G. Erouart and M. Mosser in 
Pirane~6se et les Fran}ais (Rome, 1978), 213-52, see 241). By 
1768 his activities in this field were exciting the satire of his 
rival and associate the dealer and banker Thomas Jenkins. 
Writing to the collector Charles Townley on 9 November 
Jenkins described the latest interest of Piranesi the `cav of the 
candelabri'. (For this letter see G. Vaughan's Ph.D thesis `The 
Collecting of Classical Antiquities in the Eighteenth Century: 
A Study of Charles Townley (1737-1805) and his Circle' 
(Oxford, 1988), 42-3.)

Jenkins mentions a couple of candelabra which it seems 
Piranesi had hoped that Townley might buy, and also notes 
that Piranesi has composed a monument for himself. His 
`third Candelabra'_perhaps meaning this monument_`is 
compleatd, the which As he sais, was found tele quale as well 
as the other two in Adrians Villa'. Jenkins concludes by 
reporting that `he declares he does not wish to sell any part 
of his collection' which, it is implied, would not fool Townley. 
Piranesi's chimneypieces were for sale and according to this 
letter he had hoped to sell a pair of candelabra to Townley: 
over the following decade, the last of Piranesi's life, he sold a 
great deal from his museum. The etchings which he had 
made during those years and which were assembled in the 
two volumes of his Vasi, candelabri, cippi, sarcophaghi, 
tripodi, lucerne, ed ornamenti antichi in 1778, the year of his 
death, were designed to promote business as well as to assist 
learning, since they recorded sales and advertised work for 
sale. Nevertheless, it does seem to have been the case that 
Piranesi wished to keep much of his collection together and 
he enjoined his heirs to preserve it as a museum. His son 
Francesco in fact continued to sell choice items, to British and 
other foreign collectors and to the papal museum, before 
selling the bulk of the collection in 1792 to King Gustavus 
III of Sweden (O. Neverov, `Giovanni Battista Piranesi, der 
Antikensammler', Xenia, 3 (1982), 71-90; C. Gasparri, `La 
Galleria Piranesi da Giovan Battista a Francesco', Xenia, 3 
(1982), 91-107.
It is not hard to explain why Piranesi became so interested 
in candelabra. There were no antiquities in Rome more talked 
about in the latter 1760s than the exceptionally grand 
Hadrianic marble candelabra with their extraordinary 
undercut acanthus leaves acquired by Jenkins from the 
Barberini family in 1766 and sold by him to William Lock of 
Norbury in the following year but blocked for export by 
Winckelman in his capacity as Prefect of Antiquities. They 
were then acquired by the new Pope Clement XIV and were 
one of the pretexts for the creation at the end of the decade 
of his new museum in the Vatican. In 1770 also a great 
antique candelabrum was presented to the pope by Cardinal 
Zelanda (and an erudite paper published on it in the Giornale 
pisano by Gaetano Marini). In the following years Pope 
Clement secured the antique candelabra preserved in
S. Costanza and S. Agnese for his museum.
The earliest evidence of Piranesi designing his own 
candelabra is to be found in his Diverse maniere d'adornare 
i camini, published in 1769 but prepared over the previous 
years, in which there are high relief candelabra adorning the 
uprights of one chimneypiece, freestanding candelabra to 
either side of another one, and smaller, presumably ormolu, 
candelabra both on a chimneypiece and by themselves 
intended as candelsticks (see pls. 20, 29, 34, and 51). Perhaps 
even more significant, and probably earlier, are the candelabra 
which Piranesi envisaged flanking the high altar of S. Giovanni 
in Laterano in one of the drawings (now in the Cooper 

Hewett Museum, New York) for redecorating the chancel of 
that basilica which he made for the Rezzonico family between 
1763 and 1765, a point first made by John Wilton Ely (The 
Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi (London, 1978), 
113). So many of Piranesi's ideas may be traced back to sources 
in his native city that it is worth mentioning the bronze 
candlestands which were such an impressive feature of 
churches in Venice and the Veneto, especially since they were 
far more complex in design than any such to be seen in Rome 
and served, as it were, as anthologies of fantastic imagery.
Piranesi was so keen on the candelabrum as a type of 
sculptural architecture that he designed his own monument 
in this form_something which no one had ever thought of 
before. It was erected for a while over his tomb in the church 
of the Certosa (S. Andrea delle Fratte) but in 1779 when his 
remains were moved to S. Maria del Priorato (the church of 
the Knights of Malta on the Aventine which Piranesi had 
rebuilt) the candelabrum was replaced by the portrait statue 
by Angelini and so reentered the family collection. It was 
then sold to Cardinal Braschi from whom it was appropriated 
by the French and placed in the Louvre (Gasparri, op. cit. 
106 n. 48). It may be to this memorial candelabrum that 
Jenkins refers in his letter to Townley, although it was not in 
fact composed out of fragments excavated at Hadrian's Villa 
but, according to Piranesi's own text on his print of it (in 
Vasi, candelabri, cippi . . .), out of pieces `dimessi' in Palazzo 
Salviati at Longara.
The candelabra in the Ashmolean Museum are, after that 
in the Louvre, the most splendid and imposing of those that 
Piranesi assembled. In the first of the two prints which he 
made of No. 77, he states explicitly that it was reconstructed 
from pieces discovered in the Pantanello Lake at Hadrian's 
Villa in 1769 when it was drained by Gavin Hamilton. The 
earliest of the two prints made of No. 78 states that it had 
the same origin, although the date is not given. Legrand's 
biography implies that these discoveries in the Pantanello were 
the initial stimulus to the creation of Piranesi's museum. 
However, as Dr Vaughan observes (in his thesis cited above, 
96-8), Jenkins letter reveals that Piranesi not only had a 
considerable collection before 1769 but had also access to 
excavations at the Villa before then, which is significant in 
view of Hamilton's own observation that Piranesi had played 
a part in identifying the best location for his immensely fruitful 
excavation there (Vaughan, op. cit. 96-8). The etchings of 
Hadrian's Villa, surely the greatest of all Piranesi's prints, 
belong, significantly to the late 1760s, and he must have spent 
much time there.
The size of Piranesi's `museum' in Palazzo Tomati, Strada 
Felice, was commented upon by many. A letter to Townley 
from the architect Vincenzo Brenna of 10 February 1769 
describes the numerous botteghe in the Strada Felice taken 
over by the sculptor and the thirty people employed by him 
to work the marble (Vaughan, op. cit. 98). This may be an 
exaggeration, for the first of the three carvers whom Legrand 

mentions as employed by Piranesi, Lorenzo Cardelli, is unlikely 
ever to have been a member of Piranesi's household factory. 
Cardelli had his own workshop_`entrando nella Strada 
Condotti', as it is listed on a memorandum of notable suppliers 
of antiquities compiled in 1769 or 1770 in connection with 
the foundation of the new Vatican museum by Clement XIV 
(S. Howard, `An Antiquarian Handlist and the Beginnings 
of the PioClementino', EighteenthCentury Studies (autumn 
1973), 40-61). Moreover, Cordelli either had other artists 
working for him or at least retailed their work, for the mosaic 
on the chimneypiece which he sold to Thomas Mansel Talbot 
in 1771, and which is today at Penrice Castle, is signed by 
`Aquatti' (J. Cornforth, `Penrice Castle, Glamorgan', ii, 
Country Life (25 Sept. 1975), 757 and fig. 4). Of the two 
other sculptors mentioned by Legrand, `Pronzoni' and 
`Jacquietti', the first must be Franzoni, who certainly also 
worked independently, although it is possible that he began 
his career employed exclusively by Piranesi, and the second 
has not been identified for certain (I do not accept the 
ingenious suggestion of Erouart and Mosser that it is `sans 
douter graphie fautive pour Francesco Righetti').
It has never seriously been suggested that Piranesi ever 
carved anything himself, but according to Legrand he made 
models for the broken parts whose restoration was tricky 
(`delicate'). There are a dozen or so drawings by him for 
candelabra and similar compositions, but they are very bold 
compositional studies (see especially the drawing in the British 
Museum for a candelabrum, no. 44 in A. Bettagno (ed.), 
Disegni di Giambattista Piranesi (Vicenza, 1978); and some 
of the drawings recently discovered in Bologna, pls. 116-24 
in A. Cavicchi and S. Zamboni, `Due ``taccuini'' inediti', in 
A. Bettagno (ed.), Piranesi tra Venezia e l'Europa (Florence, 
1983)). Presumably more detailed drawings or models must 
have been made for the Ashmolean candelabra, although an 
element of inspired improvisation may well have played a part 
in their construction.
In the texts on the plates which Piranesi made of the 
Ashmolean candelabra there is no indication of how extensive 
the modern additions are, nor any hint that the reconstruction 
of the parts was, to say the least, highly speculative. Of No. 
77 Piranesi wrote in his first etching, dedicated to James 
Byres, that `si rende pregievole per l'elegante Varieta~6, e l'idea 
dell'intagli con finezza di gusto scolpiti, e sue sculture con 
leggiadria distribuzione e grottesco disposte; di maniera che 
non ingombrano essi l'idea generale', which one would like 
to think was written tongueincheek. The junction of the 
kneeling faun in No. 77 with the cup above in fact looks 
hastily designed. The contraction of the candelabrum below 
the cranes is painful, as is the way in which the noses of the 
dolphins collide with the next stage. The continuation of the 
acanthus shoot from the dolphin stage to the post behind the 
cranes works better on paper than in reality. In No. 78 the 
altar base of triangular plan which is so often incorporated in 
antique candelabra is placed higher up than any antique 

precedent or modern convention could have suggested and 
seems awkward. The arrangement of fluted and reeded 
elements below the crowning cup in No. 78 is also congested 
in a manner for which there are no ancient sources. The 
candelabra, even if consisting entirely of genuine antique 
fragments, could only have been composed by Piranesi and 
there can be little doubt that the congestion, awkwardness, 
and painful transitions were enjoyed by him. Some of his 
earliest imaginary reconstructions of the `wild enormities of 
ancient magnanimity' published in his Opere varie of 1750 
already include fantastic hybrid inventions, for instance in the 
`Parte di ampio magnifico porto' a conical storiated column 
emerges from a tapering rostral column which emerges from 
an obelisk decorated with the Sfluting found on sarcophagi, 
as if parts of each antique had been reassembled by a witty 
barbarian.
In the first etching that he made of No. 78 which was 
dedicated to `Cav. Carlo Morris' Piranesi expanded, not on 
the beauty of the composition, but on the meaning on the 
imagery: the figures in low relief on the three sides of the 
altar stage represent Hercules, Minerva, and Silvanus to whom 
the candelabrum was sacred, the base was decorated with 
`teschi, e simboli allusivi alla Religione', and the sphinxes and 
elephant heads placed at the angles were guardians. The base 
with its sacrificial instruments and garlanded bucrania is surely 
modern work, although derived from a common form of 
Roman frieze. The reliefs of deities are all fragments inserted 
into a framework which must also be modern. Piranesi cannot 
have been sure that they originated in such a setting. It is hard 
to understand how the very worn figure called by him Silvanus 
can be identified with any confidence, and hard to accept that 
the other two reliefs came unaltered from the Pantanello. 
The `Hercules' has a feminine build, a light step, a fluttering 
lion pelt, and carries his club so daintily that he looks like an 
invention by Perugino, and indeed this might well be a 
fragment of a Renaissance relief. The Minerva is more 
orthodox, but the way that the further side of her shield simply 
disappears suggests an interest in aerial and evanescent effects 
more typical of the fifteenthcentury low relief than of 
Hadrianic sculpture.
The parts of the candelabra which are probably ancient, 
even if patched up and sometimes worked over, are, on No. 
77, the kneeling faun, the stage decorated with screwed 
dolphins with a scallop between them, the foliate lion's feet, 
and, most interestingly, the part of the base with expressive 
masks in low relief flanked by eagles. On No. 78 the three 
lion's legs with their pelts and heads on their knees and the 
stage decorated with squat sphinxes with vegetal tails come 
into this category. Particularly problematic are the cranes in 
No. 77 and the elephants in No. 78. A portion of the tail 
and feet of each crane is integral with the central foliate post 
and does look genuinely abraded. The heads and necks of 
each crane are certainly all new and their legs have all been 
restored, but the body of one bird (that below the tail of the 

kneeling faun) looks like ancient work only slightly recut. The 
most vividly carved of all the birds (that below the faun's 
right leg) is surely modern, although it is patched. One might 
suspect the antiquity of the elephant heads because they are 
such a peculiarity. Such heads had been employed, in 1756, 
surely without knowledge of the antique, by modellers at the 
Se~6vres factory, for vase candlestands (of which there are fine 
examples in the Wallace Collection) and had been employed 
by Piranesi himself in his chimneypiece for Burghley House 
(above the rosso antico herms) and in a design for a clock 
(both published in Diverse maniere, pls. 1 and 61) before the 
alleged discovery of the antique fragments out of which his 
candelabra were composed. Nevertheless, the elephants in 
No. 78 look genuine and had they been invented by Piranesi 
he would surely have made the leaf ornament between them 
more interesting.
Having retrieved what is likely to be ancient, we can identify 
what is certainly modern. The identical cups crowning each 
candelabrum with their curling acanthus leaves and crisp 
waterleaves between them are neither worn nor reworked 
and cannot have spent centuries in the Pantanello. This is also 
true of the altar section of No. 78 with its ram's heads and 
downcurling leaves above (but excepting the inserted reliefs). 
It is also true of the entire base of No. 78 above the lion's 
legs and below the sphinxes (all of one piece of marble with 
a diagonal grey streak) and true of the plinth of No. 77 below 
the eagles. Reviewing these modern portions we note that 
they have a consistency of handling which derives from a very 
ostentatious use of the drill_a small drill is used to create 
points of shadow in palmettes and honeysuckle and the 
serrated edges of acanthus, a larger one is used in the ram's 
heads and leaves and berries above the altar section in No. 
78 to such an extent that when looked at closely the forms 
dissolve, as when photographic reproductions reveal 
themselves as mechanical dots. This use of the drill is a feature 
of many of Piranesi's restored antiquities and is also found in 
his chimneypieces, for instance those at Burghley and 
Gorhambury, and it can be seen in some of the ornamental 
carving in the Museo PioClementino_for instance, the 
frames of the reliefs set into the wall of the Sala degli Animali 
and the decorative borders of the verde antico tables with 
winged ram supporters now in the same room (originally in 
the Sala dei Busti). It is a type of carving inspired by what has 
often been regarded as a decadent tendency in ancient Roman 
sculpture. Such drilling is never found on ancient Greek 
ornamental work. Piranesi, as a defender of the originality of 
the ancient Romans, must have known this and perhaps 
encouraged this manner of handling for this reason.
It remains to identify the sculptors who made the modern 
portions of the candelabra. As we have already pointed out, 
Legrand, whose biography was written with information 
provided by Piranesi's family, mentioned Cardelli. This 
sculptor was the restorer of the candelabrum now in the 
National Gallery, Stockholm, which came from Piranesi's 

museum. We know this from the catalogue made in 1792
by Giuseppe Angelini when it was bought by Gustavus II
(P. Kjellberg, `Piranesis antiksamlung i Nationalmuseum', 
Nationalmusei arsbok, 2 (1920), 156-69). That Cardelli was 
particularly associated with the restoration of candelabra might 
also be concluded from the fact that he is documented as 
working on the candelabra removed from S. Agnese and taken 
to the Vatican in 1772 (see the note by C. Pietrangeli 
appended to W. Amelung and G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen 
des Vaticanischen Museums, iii, ii (Berlin, 1956), 544). The 
Swedish candelabrum has many passages of drillwork similar 
to those in the Ashmolean candelabra. One wonders whether 
it was this aspect of his work which Father Thorpe had in 
mind when on 6 February 1774 he wrote to his patron Lord 
Arundel from Rome about chimneypieces that could be 
bought there, citing Cardelli in particular as someone who 
`cuts ornaments in marble as fine as the ancients did' (quoted 
by W. Rieder in `Piranesi at Gorhambury', Burlington 
Magazine (Sept. 1975), 590-1).
The second sculptor mentioned by Legrand was Franzoni. 
His special talent was for the carving of animals and he is 
documented as the restorer of most of the small sculpture 
asssembled in the Sala degli Animali created by the papal 
architect Michelangelo Simonetti in the Museo Pio
Clementino, between the mid1770s and the mid1780s. 
Outstanding among these are the birds, similar in size and 
often in type to the cranes in No. 77, and indeed including 
a crane with spread wings (W. Amelung, Die Skulpturen des 
Vaticanischen Museums, (Berlin, 1908), ii, ii, no. 122, pl. 
32, as `Reiher?') which was noted by E. Q. Visconti as coming 
from Piranesi's collection (Il Museo PioClementino, vii 
(Rome, 1807), 50-1, commentary on pl. XXVIII). Visconti 
considered that the carving of the plumage is hard to match 
in ancient or modern sculpture, but in fact it was matched by 
Franzoni. If, as seems likely, the Vatican crane had already 
been restored by Franzoni when it was acquired from 
Piranesi's collection (which was certainly also the case, 
incidentally, with the `Capra con gru e serpe' which was also 
bought for the museum from Piranesi's collection_see 
Gasparri, op. cit. 94) then it might have been because of his 
work for Piranesi on Hadrianic animal fragments that 
Franzoni came to be employed for this same purpose by the 
pope. Franzoni was (I am informed by Professor Pietrangeli) 
responsible for the magnificent winged ram supports of the 
verde antico tables mentioned above which suggests that, like 
Cardelli, he too employed this style of decorative drillwork.
Finally a note is required concerning Sir Roger Newdigate, 
the noted connoisseur and collector, also a talented amateur 
artist, who presented these remarkable objects to the 
University for which he was Member of Parliament between 
1751 and 1780. He bought the Candelabra from Piranesi 
during his second Grand Tour which he made between July 
1774 and December 1775, after the death of his first wife. 
Before buying them he had associated with Piranesi as a fellow 

antiquarian, showing him drawings of the Roman arch at 
Aosta which Piranesi promptly etched, and borrowing from 
him a plan of the Baths of Caracalla (McCarthy, op. cit.) It 
has generally been supposed that Newdigte bought the 
candelabra with Oxford in mind: possibly, however, he 
realized on returning home to his country seat of Arbury 
Hall in Warwickshire that he would find it hard to 
accommodate them and then thought of the University. 
Certainly Piranesi seems not to have realized that they were 
destined for the University and he did not mention this in 
the text on the second etching that he made of candelabrum 
No. 77 where he mentions that `Sig. Cavaliere Rugiero 
Newdigate, gentiluomo di gusto' has transported it to his 
`Patria'. `Extant in Bibliotheca Radcliviana' was, however, 
later added in small letters. Newdigate had earlier played a 
part in negotiating the donation of the Arundel marbles to 
the University: indeed it was his letter which conveyed to the 
Meeting of Convocation on 20 February 1755 the offer of 
the dowager countess of Pomfret to present her `Inestimable 
collection of Statues, Busts and other Antiquities' (R. F. 
Ovenell, The Ashmolean Museum, 1683-1894 (Oxford, 
1986), 144). Fifty years after the gift, Newdigate, shocked at 
the inadequate accommodation of the marbles in the Logic 
School, offered to pay for their cleaning, restoration, and 
transfer to the Radcliffe library where his candelabra already 
stood_he envisaged the statues placed against the piers and 
between the arches of the reading room while reliefs and 
inscriptions would be in the open space below which would 
be glazed and secured by iron bars (as it is today). His offer 
was accepted (after some attempts to deflect it) by the 
Radcliffe Trustees and then, on 24 March 1806, by 
Convocation, but the Radcliffe librarian Professor Hornsby 
refused to allow the marbles in and the decree of acceptance 
was rescinded in the following year (ibid. 184-5).

79. Callipygian Venus
34.6 cms. (height)
Bronze with a dark brown patina, ruddy where worn, with a slight 
green tinge in some areas. Hollow, lostwax, cast. The figure's right 

leg has been cast separately and attached with a clear line at mid
thigh (possibly a replacement for a leg damaged in the casting, such 

additions being unusual in Righetti's bronzes). The circular 
unmoulded base is integral. `F RIGHETTI ~^@ F ~^@ ROMAE~^@ 1788' is 
chiselled behind the figure's left foot.
Purchased on 15 November 1960 for Â£65 from Alfred Spero, `Art 
Expert', 4 Park Mansions Arcade, Knightsbridge, London SW1. 
Registered on 4 November.
Righetti, who studied under the Roman silversmith and 
bronze founder Luigi Valadier, established himself as one of 
the leading suppliers of bronze sculpture in the city in the last 
two decades of the eighteenth century. The fourpage printed 

catalogue of his products dated 1794, and in French, survives 
in the Tatham papers in the Victoria and Albert Museum 
(reproduced F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique 
(London and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 343). Like his rival 
Zoffoli (see Nos. 110-15) he specialized in bronze 
reproductions of the most famous antique sculptures, 
`fidÃ©lÃ©ment [sic] copiÃ©s . . . reduits a~6 une juste proportion 
', 
but unlike Zoffoli it seems he also produced fullsize casts. 
He also supplied ornaments for clocks, vases, and obelisks in 
bronze `dorÃ©s a~6 differentes coleurs [sic], imitant parfaitÃ©ment 

[sic] les belles dorures de France.' That his business was still 
active in 1810 is proven by his bronze reduction of Canova's 
nude standing portrait of Napoleon in the Louvre (LP. 2715) 
which is chiselled `Francesco Righetti et fils 1810'. Models 
for his copies after the antique were supplied by Roman 
sculptors such as Pacetti (it is notable that the copies of 
statues not in Rome such as the Medici Venus dated 1787, 
with Agnews, Bond Street, winter of 1985, are less accurate). 
We know from C. H. Tatham that Righetti was not himself 
personally involved in either modelling or casting but was an 
entrepreneur (see No. 15). Given the large bronzes that he 
sold, however, it is unlikely that he did not have a foundry, 
although it is not impossible that he put work out. In the list 
of 1794 the statuette of the `Venus Callipige de la Farnesine' 
was priced at 18 zecchini (nearly Â£9). Full size it could be 
supplied for 550 zecchini (Â£225). For the history and 
reputation of the Callipygian Venus see Haskell and Penny 
(op. cit. 316-18).
K. T. Parker, then Keeper of the Department, whose 
decision to acquire this bronze must have been stimulated by 
his purchase of the version of the same antique prototype 
attributed by him to Hans Mont (No. 351), described it in 
the Annual Report for 1961 as follows: `Closely based on the 
marble in its present condition, and obviously executed after 
the restoration by Albacini in the Eighteenth Century . . . It 
is by Francesco Righetti . . . dated 1788, thus clearly proving 
the minor but not uninteresting point that Albacini's 
restoration must have been fully carried out prior to that 
year.' But the bronze does not in fact correspond to the 
marble statue in its present condition in the Museum in 
Naples (to which it was taken not long before 1792_see 
Haskell and Penny, op. cit. 316-18). Superficially it may 
seem to reproduce Albacini's restorations, as Parker proposed, 
but only because Albacini's restorations were not very 
different from those they replaced. Two changes that Albacini 
did make may be mentioned: he altered the figure's hair 
dressing so that the locks tumbled down the neck to meet 
the top of the smock at the figure's left shoulder and he 
altered the end of the drapery which extends from the raised 
hand making it longer and more vertical. The Ashmolean 
Museum's bronze follows neither of these alterations, but 
follows the restorations which preceded them and which can 

be seen in the early engravings of the sculpture. In some small 
details the bronze departs from the prototype entirely: for 
instance it omits the central knot in the girdle below the 
breasts which is found in the statue today and is included in 
prints of the statue before Albacini restored it. This detail is 
included in the small bronze by Zoffoli (lot 92, Sotheby's, 
New York, 20 May 1988), which also has a bracelet on the 
figure's right wrist and a smaller base.

Supplied by Francesco RIGHETTI (1738-1819)
80 and 81. Busts of Bacchus and 
Ariadne
29 cms. (height including socles)
Bronze with a dark green and brown patina. Hollow, lostwax, casts. 
Little evidence of any tooling. Both busts are attached by integral 
metal fixtures to turned socles of rosso antico. The bust of Bacchus 

(No. 80) has a slightly chipped socle and a dent on his chin. `F. 
RIGHETTI. F. ROM\\. 1789' is chiselled in the metal across the narrow 

edge of back below the neck, in both cases, with triangular shaped 
stops, in the case of Bacchus with a long tail to the last numeral.
`B. / 404. / .' and `B. / 405. / .' are painted in white in the 
hollow interiors.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1889. B. 404 and B. 405 in his 
catalogues. Bought in Rome in 1848 for Â£5 according to the 
notebook catalogue, but in 1849 according to the earlier preliminary 

catalogue (p. 40). The bronzes have served as ornaments for coin 
cabinets in the Heberden Coin Room since 1959.
Fortnum was aware that these were reproductions of antique 
sculptures and in his large manuscript catalogue he suggested 
that both were after prototypes in the Capitoline Museum in 
Rome. The Ariadne (81) is indeed a reduced copy of a 
sculpture in that museum, a work much favoured by 
Winckelmann who published it in his Monumenti inediti of 
1767 (no. 55), and which is now considered to be an 
effeminate Dionysus ( see H. Stuart Jones, The Sculptures of 
the Museo Capitolino (Oxford, 1912), 344-5). It is an exact 
copy save that the edge of the bust comes closer to the curls 
and the leaves in the hair are worn in the antique marble. This 
bust was much reproduced in marble, sometimes with a copy 
of the Capitoline Antinous as a companion (see for instance 
the pair sold at Sotheby's, London, 7 July 1988, lots 285 
and 286).
The Bacchus was described when exhibited in Fortnum's 
lifetime as `apparently a reduced model of the Braschi 
Antinous', but this is incorrect. It is in fact based on a marble 
in the Townley Collection in the British Museum (no. 1899, 
as an AntinousDionysus). Townley acquired this from the 
Villa Pamphili and casts, upon which Righetti's model would 
no doubt have been based, were made before it was exported 
(C. W. Clairmont, Die Bildnisse des Antinous (Rome, 1966), 
51, no. 37, pl. 27). There is a difference in the inclination of 

the head and in the pattern of leaves and grapes.
For Righetti see No. 79. These two bronzes are likely to 
correspond with the busts of Ariadne and Bacchus in 
Righetti's 1794 catalogue_a bust of `Lisimaque' comes 
between them so they were not perhaps always sold as a 
pair_if so then they cost 12 zecchini each at that date. That 
was approximately Â£5_the sum for which Fortnum bought 
these examples half a century later. Small pairs of these two 
busts are also found_in bronze with ormolu socles (with 
Vinci Antiques, 124 New Bond Street, London, in 1986) and 
in ivory on ebonized socles (Christie's, London. 28 January 
1988, lot 65). The bust of Ariadne is also found oddly 
incorporated in the tripod support for a pietra dura guÃ©ridon 
table probably of the Second Empire (lot 387, Sotheby's, 
London, 17 March 1989, while that of Bacchus serves as the 
gilt bronze support for a tazza signed `Beaujault 1871' (lot 
176, Sotheby's, London, 28 September 1989). Clearly 
Righetti's models entered the stock of the Parisian bronzists. 
Inferior sandcast copies of the pair on miniature marble 
pedestals each stamped `GS [M]EDAILLE D'OR 1867' were lot 
53, Christie's, 23 March 1989.

Perhaps by Niccolo~6 (Nicolino) ROCCATAGLIATA (active 
1593-1636)
82. Infant angel, or amorino 
weeping
27.7cms. (height including bronze base); 0.5 cms. (maximum 
height of base); 10.5 cms. (height of marble pedestal)
Bronze covered with a dark brown to black varnish, red where 
thinnest, worn to expose a dull greyish greenbrown natural patina 
chiefly on the belly and thighs. Flaw on top of boy's left thigh. Den 
t 
also in thigh. Little evidence of tooling_the detail of the feathers, 

for instance, is all in the wax model. The small round bronze base 
is integral. The bronze is mounted (loosely) on a dark green breccia 

marble pedestal lettered in gold with the name of the donor and her 
brother.
Given by Miss Elinor Rokeby Price in May 1948 (registered 21 May 
1948), in memory of her brother Brigadier General Bartholomew 
G. Price, CB, CMG, DSO. Said to be from the collection of Jacob 
Goldschmidt.
Another version of this bronze is in the Staatliche Museen, 
Berlin-Dahlem (no. 1814, see W. Bode, The Italian Bronze 
Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1912), iii, pl. CCLXV, 
and Ex aere solido: Bronzen von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart 
(Berlin, 1983), no. 74 (entry by Ursula Schlegel)). It differs 
a little in the mouth (the teeth may be detected only in that 

version), the drapery, the pattern of curls, and the degree to 
which the boy's toes overlap the base which in that case is 
also supported by a subbase of egg and dart moulding (which 
is, however, separately cast). The size of the figures and the 
character of the bases suggests that they originally served as 
andiron ornaments. Such a weeping putto might have had a 
laughing putto as a companion_the merry child, 33.5 cms. 
high, from the Soulages Collection in the reserve collection 
of the Victoria and Albert Museum (84321863) perhaps 
reflects such a figure. A weeping putto of very similar character 
but smaller (19 cms. in height) and with thicker legs, and the 
hands in a different position (the back of his left hand flat 
against his left eye) which is in the collection of Sir Brinsley 
Ford (and was in the collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence) has 
as its pair a cheerful putto turning with his arms raised to his 
right. Fine examples of andirons with winged putti of similar 
character on top of them (but considerably larger in size) are
in the Nelson Atkins Museum, Kansas City (6219/1 and 2).
Putti of this type, with elongated, undulating contours and 
loosely articulated forms_plump thighs, full bellies, the 
upper chest distinguished from the torso below by a high belt 
of drapery_and with ovoid heads crowned with thick top 
curls, the open lips rendered as smooth projections, unjoined, 
not dissimilar to the chin, and the eyes, also summary in 
treatment, given segmental brows, have been particularly 
associated with Roccatagliata. They are in fact characteristic 
of Venetian sculpture generally in the second half of the 
sixteenth and in the early seventeenth century, and will be 
found in works documented as by other sculptors (the 
Annunciation, commissioned from Alessandro Vittoria by 
Hans Fugger in 1580, today in the Art Institute of Chicago_
1942.249_is a striking example) and in numerous bronzes 
which are of inferior quality (see Nos. 124, 125, 175, 176). 
But it is true that Roccatagliata seems to have been particularly 
fond of the type. Examples are the Christ Child held by the 
standing Virgin inscribed with the name `NICOLLIN', in the 
MusÃ©e National de la Renaissance, E~gcouen (CL. 13272); the 
large putti halfkneeling on the lower scrolls of the candelabra 
of S. Giorgio Maggiore, Venice (documented as made by him 
in collaboration with Cesare Groppo in the 1590s); the 
`ventidue puttini di bronzo che si convertono in scartozzi con 
campanello attaccato a una mano e candelabro sopra la testa' 
commissioned for the same church, which may be identified 
as the lightfittings in the form of angel terms surviving beside 
all the side altars, one of which retains its bell attachments, in 
that church; and, above all, the altar front crowded with child 
angels and cherubim which since 1779 has served as the 
retable of the sacristry of S. Moise~6, Venice_a work signed 
by him in 1633 and made with his son Sebastiano. It is 
noteworthy also that Roccatagliata's adults are also influenced 
by this infantile idea: this is true of the faces of his finest 
surviving works_the statues of Sts George and Stephen 
commissioned early in 1593 for the `Scabelli delle prime
sedie' of the new choir stalls and today on the altar rails of

S. Giorgio Maggiore, Venice.
It is also characteristic of Roccatagliata's work that the 
detail is not tooled but reproduced from the wax model. This 
is true, for example, of the scribbled pattern in the fringe of 
the Virgin's veil at E~gcouen, and of the decorations of St 
Stephen's chasuble. It is true too of the wings in this weeping 
putto. An idiosyncratic feature of the putto is the treatment 
of the second toes which are flattened, square ended, and 
with the nail very deeply set. This will also be found in the 
feet of the Virgin at E~gcouen, in the visible foot of the St 
George and in those of the exquisite terracotta Madonna and 
Child with Angels in Berlin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin
Dahlem, no. 2616).
In all the literature on Roccatagliata it is assumed that he 
was responsible for the casting of his bronzes, but most of 
his recorded commissions were collaborative and he may have 
only provided the models_ it is odd, if he was an experienced 
bronze founder, that the S. Moise~6 relief should have been cast 
by Jean Chenet and Martin Feron. His excellence as a 
modeller is suggested by the tradition that he was employed 
in this capacity by Tintoretto (recorded by R. Soprani in his 
Vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti genovesi, ed. C. G. Ratti 
(Genoa, 1768-9), i. 353-5).
Volker Krahn informs me that the version of this bronze 
in Berlin was reproduced by Berlin foundries in the first 
decade of this century.

Raffaello ROMANELLI (1856-1928)
83. Bessie Rosalie France
70.5 cms. (height of bust, from lowest portion of shawl to top 
of head); 63.2 cms. (height of bust, from back of bust where 
supported); 59.4 cms. (width of bust); 125.9 cms. (height of 
pedestal)
Carrara marble. The plinth is of three separate units: plinth; shaft 

with base; capital, abacus, and block. There is gold in the recesses 

of the relief of a vase, ivy leaves, and berries on the block, in the 

hollows of the capital, in the channels on the shaft, and in the 
lettering: `Boss & Mac' is chiselled in untidy cursive lettering on t 
he 
front and back faces of the base of the shaft. `BESSIE / ROSALIE / 
FRANCE' is chiselled in the tablet in the capital on its front side. 

`Prof. R. Romanelli of Florence' is chiselled lightly in cursive lett 
ers 
obliquely to proper right in the fringe of the shawl. The bust was 
cleaned by Rachel Kenward in August 1988, and the pedestal 
cleaned by Mark Norman in April 1989.
The provenance is unrecorded but is presumably connected with 
the France bequest. Remembered by Mr Taylor as being in the 
Museum when he commenced work here in 1948. Kept in the 
Museum's basement until March 1989 when placed in the Combe 

Room.
Raffaello Romanelli was the son of Pasquale Romanelli (1812-
87) a pupil and chief assistant of Lorenzo Bartolini. Pasquale, 
like Bartolini, was noted for his attempts to produce marble, 
threedimensional versions of famous paintings. His versions 
of Raphael's Madonna del Cardellino and of Allori's Sleeping 
Christ were famous. A good idea of his reputation with British 
and American visitors to Florence may be obtained from Mrs 
Trollope's `Notes on the Most Recent Productions of the 
Florentine Sculptors', Part IV, Art Journal (1 Sept. 1865), 
263-4, which describes a visit to his studio (formerly 
Bartolini's) near Porta S. Frediano. He produced candelabra 
and an elaborate chimneypiece for Lord Portarlington which 
were especially admired. Raffaello was no less successful. 
Among his most notable works in Florence are the splendid 
bronze statue of Ubaldino Peruzzi in Piazza Independenza, 
the bust of Cellini on the Ponte Vecchio, some of the 
sculptures on the fa}ade of the Duomo, and the tomb of 
Donatello in S. Lorenzo. Also by him are the tomb of Pope 
Alexander II in St Peter's, Rome, and the statues of Garibaldi 
in Siena and of Charles Albert of Savoy on the Quirinal in 
Rome. But like his father he depended for much of his business 
on foreign visitors to Florence. His son, Romano, was also 
a successful sculptor.
The variety of texture in this bust is characteristic of 
Raffaello Romanelli's work in marble. The rose petals and 
leaves in Mrs France's bosom are represented in thin and 
transparent marble, but impression is as much the sculptor's 
concern as imitation and it is not clear where the rose ends. 
The shawl appears to have first been carefully rendered in a 
low relief imitation of a textile pattern and then covered with 
rough blows of a chisel to give a vibrant effect. The hair is 
rendered by tremulously undulating chiselled channels. No 
less remarkable is the evanescent halfsmile and the half
distant expression in the eyes. A still more exceptional example 
of Romanelli's virtuosity in carving and imaginative 
portraiture is his ideal bust portrait Iris Fiorentina in the 
Museo Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome. This is also 
terminated in an unorthodox manner: the shawl overhangs 
the pedestal over which flowers and ribbons also drip.
The bizarre character of the pedestal of the bust of Mrs 
France is unlike anything found in British or French sculpture 
in the late nineteenth century but is typical of Italian work in 
this period, reflecting the innovations of Giuseppe Grandi, in 
particular in his marble portrait of Avvocato Billia 
commissioned in 1873 for the Municipal Cemetery in Milan 
(replaced by a bronze, the marble is now in the Galleria d'Arte 
Moderna, Milan, no. 1118_pl. 1114 in L. Caramel and
C. Pirovano's catalogue Opere dell'ottocento (Milan 1975)). 
Grandi also did much to popularize the revival of early 
medieval, Lombardic, geometric decoration such as is 
employed here. It was very popular in Italian sculpture around 
1880 often in combination with modern, artnouveau, 
ornament_an extreme example of its use is the bronze statue 

Rinascita by Ettore Ximenes of 1897 in the Museo Nazionale 
d'Arte Moderna, Rome.
Bessie Rosalie France was the wife of George Flood France, 
for whom see No. 84. It may be assumed that `Boss' and 
`Mac', the dachshunds represented `adorsed' in relief on either 
side of the plinth of the pedestal, were her pets.


Foundry of G. Vignali

After Raffaello ROMANELLI (1856-1928)
84. George Flood France
63.8 cms. (height including integral bronze base); 1.3 cms. 
(height of integral bronze base); 4.2 cms. (height of marble 
plinth); 19.6 cms. (length of marble plinth); 16.4 cms. (width of 
marble plinth)
Bronze of uniform dark brown patina. Hollow cast. Stamped into 
the model on back side of the integral bronze base `FONDERIE. G. 
VIGNALI. E Co' with `PARIS' continuing on the proper right side of 
the same base, the capitals irregular. Incised in the model across th 
e 
proper left corner of the upper surface of the base `Prc [: Prof. ?] 

Romanelli Ro~6./Florence. 1903.' in cursive letters. Chiselled in the 

metal on the front side of the base below the sculptor's name 
`George F. France', a simulated signature with a tail to the `e' and 

flourishes to the `Gs' and `Fs'. Mounted on ruddy brown Tuscan 
marble (marmo rossastro).
Provenance unrecorded, but presumably connected with the France 
bequest. Remembered by Mr Taylor as being in the Museum when 
he commenced work here in 1948.
G. F. France (MA Exeter College) who died on 14 February 
1933 bequeathed seventenths of his estate to the University 
of Oxford subject to the payment of a life annuity of Â£2,000. 
Threetenths of his bequest was to be devoted to the 
Ashmolean Museum. This bequest was accepted by decree of 
7 November 1933. The recipient of the annuity died on 19 
January 1947 and this bronze statuette together with the 
marble portrait bust of Mrs France (No. 83) may be supposed 
to have come to the Museum in that year_one in which the 
proper recording of accessions was, understandably, 
disrupted. Statuettes of this size and medium and informal 
character were not unknown in England_J. E. Boehm had 
indeed created something of a vogue for portraits of this sort, 
his Thackeray with pincenez and both hands in pockets and 
his Millais with one hand in pocket and the other with a 
cigarette (both plasters of which are in the National Portrait 
Gallery) belong to the early 1860s_but by the end of the 
century this had ceased to be a popular type of portraiture in 
Britain. In Italy on the other hand such statuettes were much 
in demand. A number of examples from this period are 
preserved in the Museo d'Arte Moderna in the Palazzo Pitti 

in Florence, among them two striking examples by Raffaello 
Romanelli, one of the Avvocato Alfredo Ambrosiano of 1892 
which represents him crosslegged holding a bowler hat and 
a cigar (Giorn. 741), and another of an unknown man with 
his hands in his pockets (CG. 647; Dep. Com. 240). The 
later was cast by the Vignali foundry, whose name appears on 
many Florentine bronzes of this period_the bronze statuette 
of George France is the only one I have seen in which the 
foundry is located in Paris rather than Florence and it must 
be concluded that it moved there, perhaps only briefly. Once 
cast, the bronze was perhaps sent back to Florence because 
the marble of the plinth is of a local type much favoured in 
Tuscany. Romanelli exhibited statuettes in the Royal 
Academy Summer Exhibition in 1909, one of which, of an 
English sitter, Mr Bushnell (no. 1681), was specified as of 
bronze. An Englishman, A. Bartlett, also wrote a book about 
Romanelli_Raffaello Romanelli and his works (Rome, 
1915), which is unobtainable, however, in England and not 
easy to locate in Italy. For Romanelli see also No. 83. As 
mentioned there one of his most notable public statues was 
that of Ubaldino Peruzzi in Piazza Independenza in Florence 
dated 1897_the high reliefs of its pedestal include many 
figures very similar in size and character to this statuette.
Little is known of France. He was the first son of the Revd 
George France and was born at Brockdish, Norfolk, in 1847. 
He was educated at Eton and matriculated at Exeter College, 
Oxford (also his father's college), in May 1864, taking his 
BA in 1867 and his MA in 1871. He was called to the Bar 
on 26 January of the latter year and by 1902 he had ceased 
practising. He was a JP for Middlesex and also FSA.

Breem of the Inner Temple Library).



Unknown foundry

After Jacopo SANSOVINO (Jacopo Tatti) (1486-1570)
85. Virgin and Child
48.5 cms. (height, including base); 13.7 cms. (length of bronze 
plinth); 9.8 cms. (width of bronze plinth)
Bronze with a dark brown, in parts slightly green, patina. Hollow, 
lostwax, cast, with varied, but mostly thick, walls, with some 
perforations in the folds behind the Virgin's right arm. There is 
much evidence of work with files and chisels. There is a firing crack 

at the back of the veil. An irregular large plug is visible in the dr 
apery 
on the shoulder to proper right. Circular plugs are visible in 
undraped corners of the plinth proper front right and back left. 
There is a small knob on the head of Christ with a screw hole 
behind it and a plugged hole behind that; also a small hole in the 
top of the Virgin's head and nearby much evidence of filing, over 
a patch perhaps of a different metal. The integral bronze base is 

screwed to a spreading hollowed ebonized plinth and a subplinth, 
also of wood and painted to simulate verde antico marble.
Bequeathed by Mrs Leverton Harris, 1939.
A version of this statuette, with Sansovino's name (JACOBUS 
SANSOV.) chiselled across the front of the plinth, was
published in 1922 (E. de Liphart, `Deux maquettes en bronze 
de la Renaissance italienne', Gazette des beauxarts, 64/2 
(1922), 339-47) when it was, or at least had recently been, 
in the possession of a private collector in Leningrad. This 
found its way in the 1930s into the collection of Baron 
Heinrich ThyssenBornemissza and then, through Adolph 
Loewi in 1951, to the Cleveland Museum of Art (51.316). A 
certificate signed by Planiscig in January 1935 asserted that 
the lettering corresponds `fully' to that on the plinths of the 
bronze statuettes of Sansovino's Evangelists in St Mark's in 
Venice. The similarity is hardly surprising and proves little, 
and in any case is not exact, since the Christian name 
commences here with a `J' rather than an `I' (not apparent at 
first since the tail is not firmly attached to the body of the 
letter), which is the case with no other version of the sculptor's 
name chiselled on either bronze or marble. Furthermore, it 
is curious, if the lettering is contemporary with the casting, 
that there is a disfiguring patch in the plinth between the first 
and second names. One would suppose that this was originally 
a neat enough repair for the letters to continue over it. 
However, the lettering certainly looks old and must at least 
reflect a tradition concerning the origin of the model. The 
elongated proportions and continuous curve from the Virgin's 
right foot to the fold of drapery above her head recall the 
sweep of Jacopo Sansovino's St James in the Duomo in 
Florence, while the conception of the Madonna as a mantelled 
Roman matron recalls both the seated Virgin and Child he 
made for S. Agostino in Rome and the works of his master 
Andrea Sansovino.
More decisively, as Liphart observed when first publishing 
the bronze (ibid.), the bronze is only a little varied from the 
marble Virgin and Child above the tomb of Gelasio Nichesola 
in the Duomo of Verona which it is now known that 
Sansovino executed between 1530 and 1532. Since it is smaller 
in size (the marble version is 80 cms. high) the bronze was 
supposed by Liphart to be based on a maquette; this may be 
correct but the more upright pose which is the chief difference 
might also be explained as a modification to enable it to make 
more sense as an independent group (on the tomb the figures 
are designed to comfort the bishop who reclines in effigy 
below them)_a point made by Bruce Boucher in his 
forthcoming monograph on Sansovino's sculpture. Like 
Liphart, Boucher discerns a debt to Donatello, and, noting 
that in the Cleveland statuette the irises of the Virgin's eyes 
have been perforated, he wonders whether the face was 
originally silvered, as with Donatello's Virgin and Child in 
the Santo in Padua. The finish of the Cleveland bronze 
resembles those known to have been cast after his models in 
Venice, and in particular the Evangelists of St Mark's which 

are of comparable size, and, where the darkened varnish has 
worn off, the metal is of the same chocolate colour, typical 
of a very coppery alloy, as is seen in the Evangelists. On the 
whole it seems likely that the bronze in Cleveland was made 
by, or for, Sansovino himself, and if so it may well be his first 
experiment with this medium (as Boucher also observes) 
made soon after his first contact with the thriving foundries 
and advanced casting technology of the Veneto.
When Hans Weihrauch published his Studien zum 
bildernischen Werke des Jacopo Sansovino (Strasburg, 1935), 
34 he was able to point out the existence of other bronze 
versions, unsigned, in the Goldschmidt Collection in Berlin 
and in the Gualino Collection (Galleria Sabauda, Turin). 
Another is in the Museo PoldiPezzoli, Milan (Piccolo Museo 
Mario e Fosca Crespi FC. 15/68), one is in the private 
collection of Professor Keutner in Florence, and one was sold 
at Sotheby's, London, 2 July 1973, lot 70, perhaps identical 
to one sold there 13 December 1990, lot 128. These versions, 
together with the Ashmolean's have been classed as replicas 
of a later period by W. D. Wixom (Renaissance Bronzes from 
Ohio Collections (Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, 
1975), no. 112) and, by implication, by Boucher (op. cit.). 
When compared with the Cleveland bronze the Ashmolean 
version is slightly larger (the base is 13.7 cms. long as against 
13.5, 9.8 cms. wide as against 9.5, the distance from disc 
fastening to disc fastening is 7.6 cms. as against 7.4) so it is 
not a modified aftercast. In the Ashmolean versions the 
Virgin's fingers are more pointed and delicate, the suspended 
hand of Christ is less curled, the knot of drapery under the 
Virgin's wrist is less rounded, the hair curling down beside 
the disc fastenings is slightly thicker, the divisions of the 
virgin's hair are less parallel, the surfaces generally are 
smoother. The Cleveland version is at every point closer to 
the Verona marble and more typical of Sansovino, but the 
modifications do not suggest a mechanical copyist. 
Furthermore it is wrong to group all the later versions 
together. That in Milan has a round base, a rough finish, less 
definition in the Virgin's hair, and far tighter curls on Christ's 
head. That in Turin, to judge from photographs, is imprecise 
in all its details and may be an aftercast. That in the collection 
of Professor Keutner resembles the Ashmolean version in 
details such as the delicate hand of the Virgin, but is rougher 
in finish, with numerous flaws, pitted surfaces, and evidence 
of chiselling. It also has textured surfaces, the Virgin's mantle 
being heavily punched and chiselled with trefoil flowers. That 
sold at Sotheby's in 1990 seemed very close to the Ashmolean 
version.
The holes in the backs of the heads in the Ashmolean group 
suggest that haloes were once fitted to them: these may have 
been replacements for earlier haloes to judge from the integral 
bronze projection on the top of Christ's head and the filing 
marks on top of the Virgin's.



School of Jacopo SANSOVINO (1486-1570)
86. St Jerome in penitence
26.8 cms. (height including integral plinth); 2.1 cms. (height of 
integral plinth); 35.7 cms. (length of integral plinth); 14.7 cms. 
(width of integral plinth)
Stone of an exceptionally fine grain with a pale, beige colour, polis 
hed 
in some smooth salient features such as the knee and forehead. Said 
to be Istrian stone but perhaps a limestone from the northern Veneto 

or from Brescia. There are chips missing from the edges of the 
plinth especially along the front lower edge, and at both back corner 
s. 
The saint's left wrist is broken and has been refixed with some plast 
er 
infill. This was rebroken as a result of careless handling in 1987 an 
d 
was refixed by David Armitage of the Department of Antiquities, 
old distorting plaster infill being removed at the same time. There 
are scratches to the surface in some areas which suggest cleaning and 

vestiges of paint may be discerned in some folds of drapery. Portions 

of an inscription painted in black letters on the back face of the pl 
inth 
may be made out: the word `Eglise' seems to be part of it, and, 
earlier in the line, a word including the letters `racc.'.
Bought in 1962 from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf) of The 
Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, London W1, with the France 
Fund, and with a grant from the Regional Fund administered by the 
Victoria and Albert Museum. Registered on 8 March. The sculpture 
seems always to have been displayed in the Fortnum Gallery on top 
of a cassone.
Ian Robertson, publishing this unusual small stone carving 
(the size and colour of a terracotta modello) in the Annual 
Report (1962: 63-4), felt that an `attribution to Jacopo 
Sansovino may be put forward with some confidence. The 
piece plainly shows the highmannerist character of 
Sansovino's latest work, and valid comparison may be made 
with the figures recumbent in the framework of the bronze 
door of the Sacristy of St Mark's (the model for which seems 
to have been completed in 1546). The latter comparison is 
valuable. The torsion of the head and the treatment of the 
long beard blown against the upper chest also bring to mind 
Sansovino's bronze statuette of S Matthew on the altar rail 
of the Basilica of St Mark's (installed 1553) and his colossal 
marble Neptune (1554-67) on the Scala dei Giganti in the 
courtyard of the Doge's Palace. Such comparisons, howevr, 
only enable us to associate the figure with Sansovino's large 
school. The elongation of the saint's body and the treatment 
of the anatomy as a sequence of rounded lumps, loosely if 
dynamically related, suggest some of the tendencies in the 
work of his followers which may also be observed in figures 
invented by Tintoretto_particularly pertinent in this 

connection are the river gods in the spandrels of the library 
of San Marco delegated by Sansovino in the mid1550s to 
Vittoria, Cattaneo, Ammanati, and Tommaso Lombardo.
The existence of independent statuettes of St Jerome can 
be connected with the taste for small paintings of him, a taste 
which seems to have been particularly strong in the Veneto 
by the last quarter of the fifteenth cetury. The Ashmolean 
also possesses a terrracotta figure 38.5 cms. high, of the 
kneeling saint with his lion which was purchased from the 
Arcade Gallery (registered 12 November 1960), which looks 
as if it dates from the early sixteenth century.

SBORDONI (midnineteenth century)
87. Lion
33 cms. (height); 37.2 cms. (length from front to back paws); 
40.6 cms. (length of marble slab); 18 cms. (width of marble 
slab); 47 cms. (length of wooden plinth); 23.8 cms. (width of 
wooden plinth)
Bronze with a pale green to yellow tan patina. Hollow, probably 
lostwax, cast. Precisely tooled and highly polished. There are a few 

small perforations in the area of the mane. Fixed to a slab of Siena 

(yellow, flecked with grey) marble, on a rectangular, moulded plinth 

of ebonized wood.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 444 in his catalogues. 
Fortnum records that the bronze was commissioned by him in 
1853. Long displayed on top of a cabinet on the staircase outside 
the Print Room. Placed in the Fortnum Gallery in 1987.
Fortnum had this lion made (as a companion for the bronze 
Bull (No. 162). A lion must seem an odd companion given 
the relative natural size of these animals. The explanation lies 
in the Sala degli Animali of the Museo PioClementino where, 
as Fortnum knew, the antique marble prototype of his Bull 
had as its companion (on the other side of a stag carved out 
of flowered alabaster) a standing lion after which this lion was 
cast. The Vatican Lion is fashioned out of a yellow oriental 
breccia, of a colour close to that of a lion's coat, fitted with 
a tongue of rosso antico and with teeth and claws of white 
marble, and is mounted on a plinth of green porphyry. This 
`lioncino', ancient, but extensively restored by Franzoni (see 
Nos. 77 and 78), was regarded as one of the most remarkable 
of the items in this now unfashionable corner of the Vatican 
Museums. (For an idea of the esteem with which it was 
regarded see E. Q. Visconti, Opere (Milan 1818-37), vii. 52, 
pl. XXIX).
The Lion was first described on 30 June of 1780 (`un 
piccolo leone di pietra colombina, che tende al vermiglio 
lungo palmi due . . .), and was included in a list of works 
recently acquired from the Mendicant Fathers (who owned 
the Basilica of Maxentius where it was excavated), compiled 
on 14 September 1780, as item 8: `leone scolpito di certa 
breccia gialla simile al color naturale' valued at the high sum 

of 300 scudi (see C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichita~6 
sotto il pontificato di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 32, 41). Fortnum 
recorded that the foundry which cast his lion was that of 
Sbordoni in Rome. The Sbordoni family are still engaged in 
metalwork there (the showrooms of Gino Sbordoni and 
Edoardo Litardi are at 133 Circumvallazione Clodio).
Unfortunately Fortnum is not explicit as to whether moulds 
were made of the antique on his initiative or that of the 
founder. One suspects it was Fortnum's idea (no other bronze 
version of the Bull is accompanied by a bronze version of the 
Lion), but once the founder had the moulds he seems to have 
made at least one other cast.
Another version of the bronze Lion is illustrated in Bode's 
Italian Renaissance Bronzes (1908), iii, pl. CCXLVII, as in 
Dr Simon's collection in Berlin. Bode considered this as Italian 
of the first half of the sixteenth century and it was sold on 
10-11 October 1929, lot 47 of the Berlin sale of Simon's 
collection, as a Florentine bronze of this period. J. Draper in 
his edition of Bode, suggesting that it might in fact be an 
Italian seventeenthcentury cast, noted that the bronze is now 
unlocated. It is in fact in the National Gallery, Washington 
(Samuel H. Kress Collection 1957.14.7), at present displayed 
as of the late eighteenth century (presumably because it has 
been recognized that the prototype was not available previous 
to that date), although J. PopeHennessy in his catalogue of 
Renaissance Bronzes from the Samuel H. Kress Collection 
(London, 1965), no. 499, pp. 136-7, fig. 563, assigns it 
confidently to the second quarter of the sixteenth century.
The Washington Lion differs from the Ashmolean's only 
in its tail, which falls down to the ground on the near rather 
than the far side of the lion, and in its rougher surface. But 
the tail in the case of the Washington Lion is joined and so 
might be a replacement or wrongly reattached, and the 
rougher surface turns out on careful examination to be created 
by a dark brown varnish which, where it has worn off, in the 
lion's mane, exposes chiselling as sharp and careful as in the 
Ashmolean's version. It is unlikely that a craftsman who had 
taken such trouble to tool his bronze would have obscured 
his workmanship in this way, and it seems probable that the 
varnish was applied by an unscrupulous dealer later in the 
nineteenth century to fool connoisseurs into thinking that it 
was a Renaissance piece. This ploy, which was so successful, 
depended upon a low estimate of nineteenthcentury 
craftsmanship and a lack of interest in the Museo Pio
Clementino among such connoisseurs_and of course upon 
the fact that the Ashmolean's bronze was neither publicly 
displayed nor published.
A pair of small bronze statuettes after groups of mastiffs 
attacking stags in the Sala degli Animali which were lot 126 
at Sotheby's, London, on 12 April 1990 seemed to be of 
similar colour metal, to be finished with similar precision, and 
to have identical Siena marble slabs.

Workshop of Massimiliano SOLDANI (1658-1750)

88. Autumn (Pomona)
30.7 cms. (height excluding the plinth); 2.5 cms. (height of 
plinth); 11 cms. (length of plinth); 8.9 cms. (width of plinth)
Bronze with a blackened varnish scratched and worn especially on 
the back to reveal a cool pale green and tan natural patina. Some 
traces of golden colour remain, especially on the neck. Hollow, lost 

wax, cast. Thick walls. The plinth separately cast and the figure 
attached by threaded tangs projecting from the hollowed interiors 
of the feet (but the plinth has been filled with wax, cement, and 
wood). The machined gilt metal strap around the lower part of the 
plinth has been added to conceal the projection of a wooden block 
set into it. Plugs are easily perceived in the back of the figures, e 
ach 
0.5 cms. in diameter.
Purchased 1963 as `Flora' from Alfred Spero, 4 Park Mansions 
Arcade, Knightsbridge. Registered on 25 November.
Soldani's corespondence with his patron Johann Adam, prince 
of Liechtenstein (1666-1712), reveals that in July of 1701 
the Florentine sculptor had had, for some time, in his 
possession a set of clay statuettes which reproduced the most 
notable statues, mostly antique, in the city of Florence. They 
had been made by one of his pupils under his supervision. 
From piecemoulds of these he could supply wax statuettes. 
From these stone enlargements could be cut by local 
craftsmen for the prince's palace garden in Vienna, as the 
prince had suggested. From them bronzes could also be made 
for the prince's cabinet. The prince did not like the dozen 
waxes sent to him early in 1702, but by December 1706 
Soldani had made the bronzes anyway and offered them to 
the prince who was still not interested. This probably indicates 
the period at which the bronzes became available, but the 
Medici might reasonably be supposed to have been given a 
set already and they are likely to have served as diplomatic 
gifts. A group was in the collection of Johann Wilhelm, 
elector palatine, a soninlaw of Grand Duke Cosimo III 
de'Medici, as is shown by the inventory of the Du~8sseldorf 
Gallery on its transfer to Mannheim in 1730. However, the 
Liechtenstein correspondence makes it clear that the original 
initiative was not a courtly commission but a speculative 
venture, and the number of surviving casts, as well as the 
provenance of some of them, reveals that these reproductions 
were available to, and were perhaps designed for, the wealthy 
travellers whose importance for Italian sculptors was steadily 
increasing. This is the market which, later in the century, 
Roman founders such as Boschi, Righetti, and Zoffoli (see 
Nos. 15-16, 79-81, 110-15) were to supply with similar 
small bronze souvenirs of the antique. The whole episode has 
been explored, and Soldani's series reconstructed, with 
exemplary scholarship, by Klaus Lankheit in `Eine Serie 
barocker Antiken: Nachbildungen aus der Werkstatt des 
Massimiliano Soldani', Mitteilungen des Deutschen 
Archeologischen Instituts, Roemische Abteilung, 66 (1958), 
186-98. To this Charles Avery's article `Soldani's Small 

Bronze Statuettes after ``Old Master'' Sculptures in Florence', 
Studies in European Sculpture (London, 1981), 122-32, 
forms an indispensable supplement.
The Ashmolean's Autumn, which is recorded by neither 
Lankheit nor Avery, exists in at least three other versions: 
one is in the Gewerbemuseum, Nuremberg (Lankheit, op. 
cit., pl. 60, no. 3), another is in a private collection, Toronto, 
companion with a Vestal Virgin (Paintings and Sculptures, 
Heim Gallery, London (June-Aug. 1967), 11, nos. 24-5; 
Avery, op. cit. 126, pl. 4), and a third is in the reserve 
collection of the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich 
(69/29). Unlike the other bronzes in Soldani's series it 
corresponds with a type of bronze statuette well known in 
antiquity, of which there are fine examples in the British 
Museum (no. 1513) and in the Ashmolean Museum, 
Department of Antiquities (1971.1159). This, however, is a 
coincidence and Soldani's model was certainly a large marble 
statue in the Uffizi which had been admired in Florence for 
over a hundred years (G. Mansuelli, Galleria degli Uffizi: Le 
sculture, i (Rome, 1958), 154, no. 124, pl. 120). The 
correspondence in the body is exact except that the drapery 
in the bronze is freed from the extra supports in the marble 
(supports needed because the marble was itself derived from 
a bronze prototype). The heads however are quite different. 
That on the marble in the Uffizi today is not antique but is 
an old restoration recorded in the engraving of the statue (as 
a Pomona) which served as plate LXIII of Gori's Museum 
Florentinum, vol. iii, published in 1734. Soldani's bronze 
must record an earlier restoration, for there is no other instance 
in the series of bronzes of such a departure from the original 
prototype. It therefore possesses considerable interest as 
documenting a restoration which came to be regarded as 
inappropriate and was replaced. The restoration in question 
may well have been one for which Giovanni Battista Foggini 
or even Soldani himself had been responsible_certainly its 
lyrical radiance is very much in their manner.

Bronze with black to brown varnish worn to reveal a chocolate 
brown patina. Hollow, lostwax, cast. A crack across the figure's 
right heel. Near it is a plug; there is another in the figure's left 
leg 
above the knee_both are 0.2 cms. in diameter. There is a crack in 
the figure's left thigh under the chain mail. A band of bronze 0.1 
cms. wide in the figure's right leg just above the knee presumably 
indicates a repair or join. `B. 422.' is painted in white on the side 

of the integral bronze plinth behind the figure. The hollow plinth 
appears to have been given extra weight by a second pouring of 

bronze which conceals the point of contact with one foot, but in 
the indentation, which connects with the other foot, there are traces 

of solder and also of an iron pin.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given by him 
later in the same year. B. 422 in his catalogues. In his notebook 
catalogue he records that it was `bought of Hatfield' (for whom see 
Nos. 55, 264, 265), presumably after 1857 when the preliminary 
catalogue, in which it was not included, was compiled.
Fortnum considered that his figure perhaps represented 
Ulysses in the act of pleading. He attributed both it and a 
statuette of a warrior drawing a sword to Adriaen de Vries 
(No. 95), noting that it was `elaborated with the greatest 
care, agreeing precisely in manner and workmanship with the 
figures in relief on the cuirass of the portrait of Rudolf II in 
the South Kensington Museum'. However, he also observed 
that it was `exaggerated, almost Berninesque in manner' 
which would of course imply a later, seventeenthcentury date, 
such as now seems certainly correct for it.
Fortnum noted that he had seen one or two later and 
inferior casts of the figure. None are known to me, but there 
is a wax version, about halfsize (7.92 cms. high), in the 
Doccia porcelain factory, less precisely detailed, with the head 
differently positioned, and the figure's right hand intended to 
hold something (K. Lankheit, Die Modellsammlung der 
Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 1982), no. 913, pl. 
227). The wax models in the factory were obtained by its 
founder, Marchese Ginori, from the heirs of the leading 
families of Florentine sculptors, the Foggini and Soldani. This 
particular figure is considered by Lankheit to be perhaps by 
Vincenzo Foggini. Jennifer Montagu, who first pointed out 
the connection with the wax model (letter to Gerald Taylor 
of 16 December 1970), suggested that it might correspond 
with a `Giorgio Martire', one of a list of ten saints in an 
inventory of models at Doccia made in about 1780 (Lankheit, 
op. cit. 154). She also wondered whether it might be 
associated with a set of four statuettes recorded in a catalogue 
of the collection of `modelli e figure di terracotta, di Bossolo, 
d'avorio e d'ebano' in the `Museo' of Antonmaria
Biscioni, grandducal librarian in the mideighteenth century.
(K. Lankheit, Florentinische Barockplastik (Munich, 1962), 
284, doc. 354.) These statuettes were said to be `della mano 
di Massimiliano Soldani, e sono tutte di buon lavoro e in 
buona stato'. They represented St Andrew `appoggiata alla 
Croce', `un S. Pontefice' (a papal saint), St Augustine, and 
a `S. Miniato Guerriere'. These were said to be `circa un 
quarto di Braccio' in height, that is about 14.6 cms., which 
fits this figure if the fraction was approximate. There is in a 
private collection in London, as Dr Montagu has pointed 
out, a bronze St Augustine, clutching folios and extending a 
flaming heart, which has the same proportions, long, amply 
bearded face, large hands, swaying pose, look of pious 
desperation, and shape of plinth. It is also of similar size (19.5 
cms.; the extra height being caused by his mitre). There is 

also, in another private collection, a statuette of a papal saint 
of very similar size and style. The only problem with this 
hypothesis is that, although the Ashmolean's bronze is of a 
warrior saint, he is unlikely to be St Miniato, who is 
represented as a younger man and usually crowned. He looks 
more like a St George or a St William of Aquitaine or even a 
St Longinus. On the other hand the compiler was no expert_
he could not identify the papal saint_and might have hastily 
assumed that Miniato, as the bestknown Florentine warrior 
saint, was intended. The group seems somewhat miscellaneous 
and the saints may once have formed a different, larger group. 
In any case they must have come from a setting which was 
dismantled before they entered a `Museo'. Both the 
Ashmolean warrior saint and the St Augustine require a pretext 
for their demonstrative poses which a miniature domestic 
altar of architectural character might supply. The poses recall 
the rhetoric characteristic of saints on the skyline of baroque 
churches. Among Soldani's smaller works in bronze the best 
comparison for the expressive face and outflung gesture is 
with the oval narrative reliefs of Ambrogio Sansedoni of 1692-
1700 in Palazzo Sansedoni, Siena (Lankheit, Florentinische 
Barockplastik, 40 and 41 especially). Equally close are the little 
figures made in silver gilt by Pietro Motti in 1691, after 
Soldani's designs, for the reliquaries of S. Alessio, S. Raimondo 
di Penafort, and S. Pasquale Baylon (in Cappella dei Principi, 
S. Lorenzo, Florence, 41, 109, and 110/1945).

10.9 cms. (height of male); 11.1 cms. (height of female)
Bronze with a warm tan natural patina. Hollow, lostwax, casts,

Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 1068 and B. 1069 in 
his catalogues. `Bought in Florence', before 1857 when included 
in his preliminary catalogue as nos. 14 and 15 (p. 47).
Fortnum, who described these busts as of `Venus or 
Bacchante' and `Adonis or Bacchus', regarded them justly as 
`very elegant' models and dated them to the late sixteenth or 
early seventeenth century. The elegance_the melting flow 
of drapery and hair_and languid lyricism are more suggestive 
of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century and in 
particular of Massimiliano Soldani's sculpture in Florence 
(where the handles were acquired). The colour, the subtle 
punching in the hair, the satin finish of the flesh, are typical 

of Soldani's bronzes. The slightly turnedup nose, the parted 
lips, and the hair of the female head compares closely with 
the head of Psyche in the bronze group of Cupid and Psyche 
(Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem, 8/64; U. Schlegel, Die 
italienischen Bildwerke des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts 
(Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem, 1978), no. 46, pl. 60), 
or that of the nymph to the extreme right of his relief of 
Autumn (or the Triumph of Bacchus), and that of the nymph 
in the extreme left holding a sieve in his relief of Summer (or 
the Triumph of Ceres) both first cast in 1708 (Bayerisches 
Nationalmuseum, Munich_later casts are in the Royal 
Collection and the Spencer Art Museum of the University of 
Kansas, Lawrence; terracottas are in Palazzo Pitti, Florence). 
The fact that these handles were not given to the Museum by 
Fortnum with most of the others in his collection in 1889 
may indicate his special esteem for them. Busts of a slightly 
similar character, perhaps of the same date, serve as handles 
on the doors leading from the Sala del Settecento in the Uffizi 
Galleries. See also No. 92.

catalogue as no. 13 `Venus or Ariadne very graceful' (p. 47).
As Fortnum noted, this is a duplicate of his B. 1069 (No. 
91). There are only minor variations, the drapery of this 
version being more deeply modelled. Placing it in his 
preliminary catalogue before his B. 1069 (there no. 14) may 
suggest that he acquired it first.

Style of Massimiliano SOLDANI (1658-1740)
93. Pieta~6
45.3 cms. (height); 53.7 cms. (length at lowest part); 62.8 cms. 
(length of wooden base); 34.7 cms. (width of wooden base)
Terracotta of a pale cream and pink beige colour. Poorly fired. 
Crudely hollowed out from below. There are losses from the fourth 
toe of Christ's right foot, the end of the child angel's right wing, 

the index finger of the Virgin's right hand, the large toe of her rig 
ht 
foot. Breaks to the right leg of Christ below the knee, the large toe 

of his right foot, the child angel's left wingtip (in 1987), upper r 
ight 
arm, and right wrist, the right hand of Christ near the wrist, Christ 
's 
right arm at the bicep, Christ's left arm at the bicep, across his ne 

ck 
and upper chest, and across his abdomen have been repaired. Filled 
cracks_some of them probably breaks_in the Virgin's drapery 
near the left arm of Christ and across her left knee. The right hand 

of the child angel and the thumb of the Virgin are evidently modern. 

An old paper label inscribed `No. 149' in ink is stuck to the undersi 
de 
of the group. Mounted on a plinth, irregularly oval in plan, of pine, 

carved and gilded.
Purchased in May 1962 from Paul Wengraf of the Arcade Gallery, 
London. Registered in July. One of the first purchases made by Ian 
Robertson after his appointment as Keeper of the Department.
On acquisition the group was restored, although to what 
extent is not clear, but presumably old repairs were revised. 
The restorer was against stripping the terracotta; Robertson 
was against the idea of restoring the Virgin's foot; a missing 
wing of the angel `turned up' when the restoration was under 
way. The work was not attributed by the dealer, but 
Robertson published it as by Soldani in the Annual Report 
for 1962, claiming that it shows `close affinity with a number 
of the artist's later compositions in bronze or porcelain media'. 
Groups of the Pieta~6 or Lamentation of this size were popular 
with Soldani, both free standing and in high relief. The puffy
faced child angel tearfully contemplating (and perhaps 
preparing to kiss) the wound in Christ's right hand may be 
matched by a type of child popular in the sculpture of Soldani 
and so may the elongated and languid face of Christ. But 
Soldani, especially in his late work, gave drapery, hair, and 
rockery an agitated horizontal emphasis which is absent here.
A sample was taken from the unrestored portion of the 
plinth by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford Research 
Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in March 
1987 but it was too poorly fired to obtain a firing date from 
thermoluminescence tests (ref. 381z96).

Giovanni Francesco SUSINI (active 1592; d. 1646)
94. Seated Mars
35.4 cms. (height); 26.5 cms. (length from proper right foot to 
back of mound); 12.9 cms. (height of wooden plinth); 28 cms. 
(length of wooden plinth); 17.2 cms. (width of wooden plinth)
Bronze with a darkened ruddy brown translucent varnish now largely 
worn off to reveal a golden brown patina. Hollow, lostwax, cast, 
all apparently in one piece except for the shield and the handle of 
the sword (now missing). The proper right cheek guard of the 
helmet has been broken off. Plugs of 0.5 cms. diameter visible (most 

obvious on the figure's right wrist). `IO. FR. SVSINI / FLOR. FAC.' i 
s 
chiselled in the mound upon which the god sits, beneath his right 
thigh. The stops are of triangular form, the letters very neat. The 
bronze is mounted on a moulded mahogany plinth.

Given by Mrs Otto Gutekunst in memory of her husband in 1953. 
Registered on 15 July. The bronze had been bought in at Christie's, 
London, 25 June 1953, where it was lot 10 (with its present plinth).
The bronze is one of a few signed examples of exquisitely 
finished and careful copies of celebrated antique statues which 
were, as we know from Baldinucci's life, a speciality of 
Gianfrancesco Susini, as they had been of his uncle Antonio. 
The antique marble, now in the Museo delle Terme, Rome, 
had been acquired by the Ludovisi in Rome by the first half 
of 1622 and was recorded as having been restored by 20 June 
of that year. It was generally regarded as representing Mars. 
(See F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London 
and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 260-2, for a full account of 
its fame.) This is probably the earliest reproduction of it. The 
bronze lacks the sword handle which is one of the restorations 
with which Bernini supplied the antique statue_but this is 
because it has been detached. Also absent is the Cupid playing 
beneath the god's extended right foot, the most notable 
embellishment by Bernini. This has been explained both as 
precocious antiquarian purism on the part of Susini or his 
patron and as evidence that Susini had access to the antique 
before it was restored. The former possibility is hinted at by 
Haskell and Penny, op. cit. 260, who point out that the 
Cupid is also excluded in the prints of the statue in de Rossi's 
anthology (P. A. Maffei, Raccolta di statue antiche e moderne 
(Rome, 1704), pl. LXVI, LXVII) and in late eighteenth
century biscuit porcelain versions. The latter possibility is 
stated as a fact by PopeHennessy (Italian Bronze Statuettes 
(Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1961), no. 133). 
However, if the sculptor, and the subsequent draftsmen and 
modellers, were using casts after the antique original, these 
may have excluded the Cupid because of the complication in 
the moulds which it would have occasioned. It is, however, 
more probable, that Susini did include the Cupid, and it is 
no longer in place: it would have been separately cast 
(touching the Mars at no point) and so could easily have been 
detached. In this connection it is significant that the plinth 
here cannot be the original one and is unlikely to be more 
than a hundred years old.
The bronze may have been one of a series of copies after 
notable marbles in the Ludovisi Collection: Susini also signed 
bronze versions of the Dying Gladiator (Museo Nazionale, 
Bargello, Florence) and one of the Hermaphrodite 
(Metropolitan Museum, New York)_the latter dated 1639_
and Baldinucci records that he also made a copy of the Paetus 
and Arria. (Of these, the first and third were wellknown 
Ludovisi pieces. On the other hand the Hermaphrodite has 
been supposed to be a copy of the version in the Borghese 
Collection, but it is surely after the version restored for the 
Ludovisi between 1621 and 1623, for which see Haskell and 
Penny, op. cit. 235).
Among the bronzes in the collection of AndrÃ© Le No~7tre 
was `Le dieu Mars, assis, d'apre~6s l'antique' valued at the high 
sum of 150 livres (J. Guiffrey, `Testament et inventaire apre~6s 

dÃ©ce~6s de AndrÃ© Le No~7tre et autres documents le concernant', 
Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de l'Histoire de l'Art Fran}ais (1911), 
257, no. 365). This might have been the Ashmolean Susini 
or another version of it, although no other version has been 
traced. No other small bronze copy of the Mars that I have 
seen seems likely to have been made before 1700.

Probably by Ferdinando TACCA (active from 1640; d. 1686)
95. Warrior drawing a sword
14.1 cms. (height)
Bronze with a natural chocolatebrown patina. Hollow, lostwax, 
cast. There is an integral base in the form of a thin rectangular pla 
te 
of bronze, cracked from the central hole whereby it is bolted to a 
plinth of ebonized wood. ` 423' painted in white on the upper 
surface of the base behind the feet.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. Given later in the 
same year. B. 423 in his catalogues. Presumably acquired after 1857 
when Fortnum compiled his preliminary catalogue in which this is 
not included.
This little bronze was considered by Fortnum as `assuredly' 
by the same hand as his no. 422 (No. 89 here)_it was the 
hand, he proposed, of Adriaen de Vries. C. F. Bell in his 
annotations to Fortnum's large catalogue noted that he did 
not `feel sure' of this and recorded Bode's opinion that this 
bronze was perhaps Flemish of the period of Louis XIV. 
Jennifer Montagu in a letter to Gerald Taylor of 16 December 
1970 mentioned as perhaps of significance the fact that 
Massimiliano Soldani is documented as having made a model 
of a `Gladiatore in atto di tirare stoccata' (K. Lankheit, Die 
Modellsammlung der Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 
1982), 334, doc. 671), but she considered the bronze as earlier 
in date. The type of balletic torsion, the arrested action, and 
the elongated proportions are found in several of the high 
relief foreground figures (almost threedimensional statuettes) 
in the bronze relief of the Martyrdom of St Stephen by 
Ferdinando Tacca, given to S. Stefano al Ponte in Florence 
by Giovanni Bartolomei in 1656. And we find there the same 
alert face, with small chin, large eyes, and sharply tapering 
nose, also the same style of moustache and of armour. On 
the basis of comparisons with the bronze relief in S. Stefano 
a series of lively twofigure narrative groups with subjects 
from Ariosto and Ovid have been convincingly attributed to 
Tacca, and this bronze, which is less than half of the size of 
these, looks like half a group of similar character. `It was 
Ferdinando Tacca', Anthony Radcliffe proposed, when 
publishing these groups, `who led the way in Florence towards 
a new function for the small bronze group, who transformed 
it from an object to be handled or walked around into a sort 
of miniature theatre to be precisely placed upon a piece of 
furniture and to be seen from one view only' (`Ferdinando 
Tacca, the Missing Link in Florentine Baroque Bronzes', in 
H. Keutner (ed.), Kunst des Barock in der Toskana (Munich, 
1976), 14-23_quotation taken from p. 22). In style the 

figure is also close to those in reliefs attributed to Fanelli but 
it seems likely that Fanelli derived much of his style and even 
took some of his models from Tacca and other Florentines 
(see also No. 97).
A version of this figure was lot 151 at Christie's, London, 
5 December 1989, with an attribution to Fanelli. It differed 
in that the metal was very brassy (it has been polished), all 
details were less distinct, and there was a double plinth (which 
strongly suggests an aftercast). That this version was from a 
series perhaps intended for a cabinet is suggested by the 
roman numeral `VI' chiselled underneath the plinth. The 
nature of the plinth on the Ashmolean version strongly 
suggests that it too was designed to be fixed to a cabinet. A 
cast of the statuette was attached to a good cabinet on stand, 
lot 115 at Christie's, London, 5 July 1990. This was exhibited 
by Jonathan Harris at the 1991 Grosvenor House Antiques 
Fair with the information that it was recorded in an inventory 
of 1724 at Drayton House, Northants. The cabinet was 
decorated with plaques of pale beige marble with dendritic 
markings framed in ripple mouldings. It has been described 
as Flemish but may be Italian. The companion bronzes were 
of similar finish, but far less interesting design.

Orlando pulling the Orc from the

15.4 cms. (height); 12.1 cms. (length of bronze plinth); 10.1 cms. 
(width of bronze plinth); 14.5 cms. (length of wooden base); 
11.5 cms. (width of wooden base); 4.5 cms. (height of wooden 
base)
Bronze with a natural warm chocolate patina. There are a few traces 
of darkened varnish, e.g. around the strap fixing the arms to the 
jaw. Hollow, lostwax, cast in one piece including the plinth. The 
interior is now filled with plaster of Paris in which a screw is set 

fixing the bronze to a walnut base. `B.84.' painted white behind 
the Orc.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed by him 
in 1899. No. 1084 in his catalogues. `For many years in the Passerini 

family . . . At Professor Passerini's death (the entomologist) it was 

sent to England by Freppa the dealer and bought by me in . . .' The 
date is omitted in the large catalogue. In the earlier notebook 
catalogue there is a fragment of a letter by Freppa in French from 
Florence. The acquisition was presumably made after 1857 because 
it is not recorded in the preliminary catalogue compiled in that year 
. 
For Freppa see below. It is almost certainly `the Cellini inkstand' 
recorded in an MS `memoranda of prices paid' under 1860 with 
the very high price of Â£35.
Fortnum catalogued this `quaint and charming bronze' as 

Florentine of the first half of the sixteenth century. The 
subject, as seems first to have been pointed out to him by the 
dealer Freppa, comes from the most popular verse romance, 
not only of sixteenth and seventeenthcentury Italy but of 
the whole of modern European literature, the Orlando furioso 
by Ariosto. The Orc is a sea monster placated by the 
inhabitants of the island of Ebuda who feed him damsels. He 
is first mentioned in Canto 8 when Angelica is kidnapped and 
chained naked to a rock to await this fate. In Canto 10 
Ruggiero, flying by on his hippogriff, espies her. The Orc is 
approaching_a huge coiling mass unlike any animal except 
for its head which has the protruding eyes and teeth of a boar 
(stanza 101). Ruggiero fights it from his flying steed with 
sword and lance:

The audacious fly on dusty August days (stanza 105)
Like battle with the snapping mastiff wages
The audacious fly on dusty August days (stanza 105)
but he cannot penetrate the Orc's skin. Eventually he succeeds 
in stunning him with a reflected beam from his magic shield. 
He then carries off Angelica to a nearby wood and at the close 
of the canto he is furiously stripping off his armour, overcome 
with desire for her. In canto 11, Angelica saves herself just in 
time_making herself invisible by placing a magic ring in her 
mouth_and the frustrated Ruggiero is involved in another 
adventure. Another hero, Orlando, arrives to find the revived 
Orc about to devour another fair victim, Olympia. He strips 
off his armour, and gets in a little boat equipped with a small 
sword and a huge anchor. When the Orc advances upon him 
he jams the anchor in his open jaws:

Lest as they hack the rock in front the roof behind them fall.
So prudent miners prop the tunnel as they crawl
Lest as they hack the rock in front the roof behind them fall.
(stanza 43)
Entering the Orc's throat Orlando slashes at it with his sword. 
When the Orc dives he swims out and then tugs the monster, 
which is belching blood and thrashing foam, to shore (stanza 
43). For obvious reasons Tacca has altered the relative scale 
of the Orc implicit in the poet's similes and he has also put 
the hero on the Orc's back, rather than on a nearby rock, as 
he hauls at the anchor cable. A part of the anchor may 
originally have been visible in the monster's mouth.
This certainly does not prove that the bronze is Italian, but 
there are parallels with other pieces which would seem to be 
Italian (compare, for example, the ornament on the integral 
bronze base and the convolutions of the monster's tail with 
ornament and tail in the inkstand with a mermaid, No. 233), 
and there is the Florentine provenance, which also support 
such an assumption and make us doubt the suggestion that 
the bronze might be German. (In addition, there is the 
armorial evidence set out below.)
Fortnum and Bode seem both to have known the piece 
when it was still with Professor Passerini, and so did 

Alessandro Castellani the scholarly Roman dealer. The fact 
that it passed through the hands of Freppa, who was exposed, 
in1868, as the employer of the forger Bastianini, might 
otherwise have given cause for alarm. Fortnum noted that it 
had long been regarded by the Passerini as `the work of 
Benvenuto Cellini' and he considered that it `has very great 
affinity' with Cellini and was especially reminiscent of the 
`treatment' of the reliefs on the base of the Perseus in Florence 
and the `action on the Vienna salt cellar'. Castellani thought 
it `might be by Bambaia an opinion not shared by Dr. Bode 
or by me, we agreeing rather in its Cellini manner'. Bode later 
classed it as Venetian of about 1575 (Italian Bronze Statuettes 
of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), iii, fig. 22).
The fragmentary letter from Freppa, also referred to, reveals 
that he also suggested to Fortnum that the arms on the 
escutcheon hung by a strap over the monster's upper jaw 
were those of the Rondinelli family of Florence. The bearings 
are a chevron between three stars of six points; in chief a label 
of four between which are three fleursdelis. The crest is a 
salamander. C. F. Bell seems to have further investigated the 
arms and noted that the lilies and label in chief_part of the 
bearings of Anjou_suggest that it belonged to a family which 
had, or once had, Guelf affiliations. Michael Maclagan 
examined the arms in May 1977 at the suggestion of 
Christopher Lloyd and reported that they looked authentic, 
also distinctly Italian rather than German (the suggestion that 
the bronze was German had recently been made), especially 
because of the Guelf factor (already mentioned by Bell). He 
considered that it could refer to one of two Italian houses: 
the Lapi of Bologna or the ScarlattiRondinelli of Florence, 
more probably the latter, although their stars should normally 
have eight points (a detail to which a modeller might not have 
felt inclined to attend).
Another version, sold on 7 April 1970 at Sotheby's, London 
(lot 95), resold at Phillips, London, 30 November 1976 (lot 
175), was bought by D. Katz (then of 22 Grosvenor Square, 
London). It is approximately the same size but looks from 
photographs as if it was neither modelled nor chased with 
comparable care and might even be a modified aftercast. The 
chief difference is that it lacks the escutcheon, the hero has 
no ornamental boots, and the sword blade has been broken 
off; but in addition many details are simplified in form and 
less sharply finished. The base mouldings have no corner 
leaves and consist of incised lines without raised rectangular 
elements superimposed, the rope is less defined (and is not 
tightly drawn), the fins and tail are less undercut and the 
fringe along the back less minutely defined. Mr Katz in his 
letters to the Department in 1979 observed the relationship 
not only with the Mermaid inkstand (No. 233) but also with 
the small bronze statuette of a warrior drawing a sword (No. 
95) which is indeed of very similar metal, finish, and character, 
and it is surprising that Fortnum himself, who owned both 
items, did not note this connection. The figure looks very 
similar in the face and the armour to those by Ferdinando 

Tacca and it is surely relevant that among the larger groups 
convincingly attributed to Tacca are several from Ariosto, 
including one of Angelica eluding her excited saviour by 
placing the ring in her mouth as he tears his clothes off 
(Louvre 0A. 7811).

After a model perhaps by Ferdinando TACCA (active from 
1640; d. 1686)
97. Marcus Curtius leaping into the 
gulf
29.2 cms. (height); 44 cms. (width)
Lead with a ruddy gold brown `bronze finish'. The lead is partially 
diseased (possibly from storage in an oak cupboard), disfigured with 

white efflorescence, as well as scratched and bent (especially in the 

lower corner to proper right). An arm of the warrior by the bank to 
proper left has been broken off, as has part of the hero's right hand 
. 
The right forearm of the warrior nearest the rear legs of the horse 
is broken but not detached. The elements in highest relief_the hero 
and some of his mount, the head and one leg of the dog barking 
at him, and much of the warrior leaning forward_are separately 
cast and let into the relief. Scratched on the rear are the words 
`PROVENANCE UNCERTAIN / THIS PLAQUE WAS FOUND IN A / RUSKIN 
SCHOOL CABINET (REFERENCE SERIES) / 1976'.
Provenance uncertain. See scratched inscription above.
A bronze version of this relief measuring 27~^V41 cms. in the 
Staatliche Museen, East Berlin (inv. 5042), was published in 
E. F. Bange, Staaliche Museen zu Berlin: Bildwerke der 
christlichen Epochen, III, ii (Berlin, 1922), no. 53, and pl. 20, 
as an anonymous late seventeenthcentury work. There are a 
number of minor variations: the Berlin version does not 
include a stump beneath the horse's belly but does have trees 
on a hill slope rising above the horse's tail; it does not include 
a spire on top of the distant tower, its foliage is defined more 
by punched marks than short lines, the warrior leaning 
forward holds his torch or baton in an upright position, and 
the dog appears to bite the horse's leg. Neither version is of 
high quality (although the bronze is superior to the lead) but 
they seem likely to reflect some superior prototype. Anthony 
Radcliffe proposed in a footnote that this might have been by 
Ferdinando Tacca (`Ferdinando Tacca, the Missing Link in 
Florentine Baroque Bronzes', in H. Keutner (ed.), Kunst des 
Barock in der Toskana (Munich, 1976), 23 n.) and there are 
numerous points of comparison with Tacca's bronze relief of 
the Martyrdom of St Stephen (given to S. Stefano al Ponte in 
Florence by Giovanni Bartolomei in 1656): in both there is a 
mixture of a few figures in very high, almost detached, relief 
with pictorial low relief and landscape; the same open poses 
of the high relief figures, the same densely composed choral 
groups, the same interpretation of antique dress, the same 
longbearded sages. Francesco Fanelli has also been suggested 
as the author of the Berlin relief and it is similar to the reliefs 

of the Carrying of the Cross and the Holy Family in the 
Robber's House which he is known to have cast but it is not 
certain that these compositions were invented by him and in 
any case Fanelli may well have been indebted to Ferdinando 
Tacca or other Florentine sculptors of that date.
Another version of this relief, in bronze, less high and with 
only minimal landscape background was lot 154 at Sotheby's, 
London, 13 December 1990.

Royal porcelain factory, Naples

After a model by Filippo Tommaso TAGLIOLINI (1745-
1809)
98. River god
21.55 cms. (height, including plinth); 22 cms. (length excluding 
projecting foot); 10.5 cms. (width)
Biscuit porcelain, somewhat scratched and much discoloured from 
engrained dirt. Hollow cast, open below the plinth. There is a firing 

crack in the reverse of the figure. The upperside of the large toe of 

the god's right foot and the end of the index finger of his right han 
d 
have been broken off and are missing.
No provenance recorded.
Having been awarded the first prize for sculpture in the 
Consorso Clementino at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome 
in 1766, Tagliolini travelled to Venice in 1767 where he 
worked for at least six years in a porcelain factory, moving 
probably soon afterwards to the porcelain factory in Vienna, 
whence in 1780, apparently at the request of the king of 
Naples and the Two Sicilies, and in company with a furnace 
technician, Magnus Fessler, he travelled to Naples to work 
for the royal porcelain factory there. By 1781 he was appointed 
`capomodellatore'. He worked under the inspiring direction 
of the artistic adviser to the court, the learned and cultivated 
Marchese Domenico Venuti (1745-1817) and was 
responsible for modelling a succession of graceful and delicate 
biscuit statuettes, many of them after, or inspired by, antique 
statues (and especially those locally available from the Farnese 
Collection and the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii), 
some of them incorporated into highly ambitious groups and 
extravagant presentation desserts composed of numerous 
figures. He was chief modeller until the sale of the factory 
under the French in 1807 and was employed in the final years 
of his life in restoring antique sculpture. Tagliolini's biscuit 
statuettes are unmarked and have often been confused with 
the contemporary productions of the Volpato factory (see 
No. 106). The full extent of his activity and the quality of his 
work have only become clear with the publication of Lo 
scultore Filippo Tagliolini e la porcellana di Napoli by Alvar 
Gonza~5lezPalacios (Turin, 1988).
A list, compiled in 1805, of models made at the factory 
since 1776, with their prices, includes, under the section 

headed `serie di figure', `fiumi sedenti' for seven ducats 
(presumably each) and in the inventory of the factory, made 
when it was sold two years later in 1807, a number of river 
gods are also recorded, including a group representing the 
four parts of the world valued at fortyeight ducats (ibid. 171, 
196). Gonza~5lezPalacios lists surviving versions of such river 
gods in Naples (one at the Museo di Capodimonte (inv. 
5268) is coloured and gilded, one in biscuit is in the Museo 
di San Martino (inv. 273), and another is in the Museo 
Artistico Industriale, Naples (inv. 96) and in Turin (Museo 
Civico 1543). None of these is now part of a group. The first 
two cited are adapted from the less familiar of the two statues 
of the Nile in the Vatican Museum (ibid., no. 59). The 
Ashmolean's statuette, which is very close to this Nile 
statuette in size, general character, pose, and the modelling 
of beard and drapery, may correspond with the example in 
the Museo Artistico Industriale (h. 21 cms.) of which, 
however, no illustration is available. The plinth of the 
Ashmolean statuette is of a pattern, more or less regular in 
shape but slightly suggestive of rockwork, favoured in many 
antique marble sculptures whereas those of the Nile statuettes 
have smooth sides, but such variation is not unexpected and 
both forms of plinth were favoured by the factory (for other 
rockwork plinths see ibid., nos 3, 29, 30, 33). Further 
confirmation that the Ashmolean river god was modelled by 
Tagliolini is found in the figure of Time on a porcelain and 
ormolu clock in the Museo di Capodimonte which is adapted 
from it (Gonza~5lezPalacios, op. cit., no. 71).


Unknown foundry, probably Roman

After Bertel THORVALDSEN (1770-1844)
99. Venus
14 cms. (height; 4.35 cms. (diameter of base)
Bronze with a dark grey patina, with hints of green. Very heavy, 
probably solid, cast. A tang project from the integral base 
(photographed with an improvised plasticine support)
Given or bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum (the large catalogue is 
not annotated so it was probably only received after his death in 
1899). B. 429 in his catalogues. According to the notebook catalogue 

`bought at Naples', apparently after 1857 when the preliminary 
catalogue, in which it was not included, was compiled.
Fortnum supposed that this was probably executed in Italy in 
about 1815 (large catalogue) or `1815-20' (notebook 
catalogue)_i.e. at the period of Thorvaldsen's fullsize statue 
of which it is a miniature reproduction. Thorvaldsen created 
his Venus between 1813 and 1816. It was bought by the 
banker Henry Labouche~6re and taken to London, but a cast 
remained in the artist's studio. The cast is now in the 
Thorvaldsen Museum Copenhagen (A. 12), as is the marble 
(A. 853). A similar small bronze of the Venus is in the Museo 
Nazionale di Palazzo Venezia, Rome, mounted on an 

alabaster base.


Unknown manufacturer

After Bertel THORVALDSEN (1770-1844)
100, 101, and 102. Three strips of a relief representing the triumphal entry of Alexander into Babylon
30.6 cms. (length of No. 100); 32 cms. (length of No. 101); 
40.9 cms. (length of No 102); 5 cms. (height of each strip)
Bronze with a yellowed varnish. No. 100 has a rusty deposit on top 
of the bronze presumably from storage near iron. There are pin 
holes in the corners of all three strips. The lower corners of No. 101 have been torn off around these holes.
Provenance unrecorded.
Thorvaldsen made his plaster frieze of the Triumph of 
Alexander (as it was commonly abbreviated) for the Salone 
d'Onore in the Quirinal Palace in 1812. It was planned in 
collaboration with the architect Raffaele Stern with a 
programme devised by Vivant Denon and Martial Daru for 
the anticipated official visit of the modern Alexander, the 
Emperor Napoleon. The work was repeated during the 1820s 
in plaster for patrons in Munich and Frankfurt and in marble 
for the Palace of Christiansborg at Copenhagen (subsequently 
destroyed by fire) and for GiovanniBattista Sommariva's Villa 
Carlotta (B. J~rrnaes, `Il patriarca del bassorilievo', in Bertel 
Thorvaldsen (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome, 
1989-90), 45-6). The portion showing the emperor on his 
chariot was later repeated, with revisions, as one of a series 
of reliefs for the courtyard of Palazzo Torlonia in Rome in 
1837. The frieze enjoyed enormous fame and was also 
reproduced extensively outside the artist's studio_in plaster 
for staircase halls and in marble for chimneypieces in British 
houses, for example. Fine plaster miniatures were sold to 
tourists in Rome and these metal strips, which are imprecisely 
modelled, may derive from aftercasts of such plasters. Mass 
production seems already to have been envisaged by 1825 
(E. di Majo and S. Susinno, `Thorvaldsen e Roma', ibid. 24 
n. 66).
Scenes of quiet rural life in ancient Babylon (No. 100) give 
way to preparations for the conqueror's reception (No. 101) 
and the actual homage to him and his entourage with a 
personification of Peace greeting his chariot (No. 102).


Style of Andrea VERROCCHIO (b. c.1435; d. 1488)
103. Head of a youth
25.2 cms. (height); 11.8 cms. (height of socle)
Imperial porphyry. There is a break through the front of the neck 
and the lowest part of the hair behind. Some of the cement, tinted 
to match the porphyry, is now apparent in the join. One prominent 
curl at the centre of the front of the hair has been broken off and 

the stump recarved to conceal the loss. Chips are missing at the 
front of the chest. The crown of the head and the underside of the 
bust at the back are only roughly finished. (See below for a discussi 
on 
of this.) The head is mounted on a turned dovegrey (bardiglio) 
marble socle. `1975.86' is painted in white on the back of the prong 

attaching the head to the socle. A visiting card engraved `Miss Joan 

Evans' is sellotaped to the underside of the Socle. On it is written 

`Bought at Conway Sale 1951 for Â£68 / Bought by Frank Conway 
in Venice 1912 for 1500 lire (Â£50).'
Given by Dr Joan Evans in 1975. Registered on 15 July. See above 
for provenance on card. Placed on display in the Fortnum Gallery 
in October 1989.
The head seems never to have been displayed in the Museum 
and has attracted little scholarly attention. It was registered, 
and described in the Annual Report (1975: 30), as `Roman' 
but `refashioned probably in the nineteenth century'_a note 
in the Register indicates that Conway, the previous owner, 
had suggested that the reworking had taken place in Florence. 
The character of the head is very distinctive and recalls the 
youthful male ideal of Andrea Verrocchio most familiar from 
his bronze David, but found also in paintings of his school 
such as no. 296 in the National Gallery, London. It is likely 
to be a modern work in the Renaissance style, dating from 
after 1850 when the appreciation of Verrocchio and the taste 
for his particular contribution to Florentine art began to 
become popular; but it is possible, as Alastair Laing has 
pointed out to me, that this is in fact a Florentine sculpture 
of the early sixteenth century by Pier Maria Serbaldi da Pescia, 
called `Il Tagliacarne' (1455-c.1520) who was the very first 
sculptor to revive the carving of the figure in the notoriously 
hard material of porphyry. The difficulty that the sculptor has 
had in carving the stone (especially evident in the hair) does 
suggest an early date, and is reminiscent of the bust of 
Polyhymnia in the Kunshistorisches Museum, Vienna (no. 
3529) and the small group of Venus with Cupid signed in 
Greek (Museo degli Argenti, Palazzo Pitti, Florence, no. 
1067_A. Giusti (ed.), Splendori di pietre dure (Palazzo Pitti, 
1988-9), 74-5, no. 1. The portion of roughhewn stone 
under the neck suggests that the head was designed to be 
inserted in a bust made of marble or stone of a contrasting 
colour. The treatment of the crown of the head, roughly 
worked but without any attempt to indicate the hair, suggests 
that it was designed to be covered by a crown or cap perhaps 
of gilded metal.


Perhaps by Alessandro VITTORIA (1525-1608)
104. Bust portrait of a bearded man
60 cms. (height); 45.3 cms. (width across shoulders); 12 cms. 
(height of block base); 25 cms. (length of block base); 23.2 cms. 

(width of block base)
White Carrara marble with numerous pale grey and rusty patches 
most pronounced on the drapery and in the moustache and nostril 
on the proper right side of the face. The bust has had additional 
blocks of marble added under each shoulder. The surface is abraded 
in parts. The bust has been mounted on a block of serpentine, with 
cement ensuring that it rests level on the block_the marble is cut 
back so that it would naturally tilt upwards.
Bought from Rodney Thesiger of Messrs. Colnaghi, Bond Street, 
1956. Registered on 5 March. Sold to Mr Thesiger by John Gere 
who bought it at the sale of Thomas Harris, Christie's, London, 22 
November 1951, lot 84. Photographs taken in the 1960s show the 
bust on a freestanding pedestal in the Farrer Gallery. It has been i 
n 
reserve for at least a decade.
In the Harris sale the bust was catalogued as a selfportrait by 
Alessandro Vittoria, but there is no good reason for this. 
That it is close to many portrait busts by Vittoria is however 
unquestionable: an interesting comparison may be made with 
the bust of Alessandro Contarini (d. 1553) set in a tondo of 
the black marble pyramid tomb in the Santo, Padua, or
with the bust of Marcantonio Grimani (d. 1565) set within
a shell niche above an epitaph in the first north chapel of
S. Sebastiano in Venice, both of them signed works. This bust 
too must have had a high mural, probably sepulchral, setting, 
within a church or chapel and the adjustment of the back of 
the bust strongly suggests the sort of modifications required 
for display on a pedestal in a gallery once it was removed from 
a tondo or niche recess. Some parts of the bust are very finely 
carved, most notably the flesh around the eyes and in the 
cheeks, and the beard beside the ears and below the lower 
lip. On the other hand the deeper channels cut into the beard 
with a running drill are crude and seem unhappily related to 
the chiselling. Perhaps when set in place the shadows in the 
beard did not tell and needed correction. A coarse use of the 
drill is found in some busts which are signed by Vittoria (one 
which it is possible to study closely is in the Louvre_
Chauchard bequest 1910, M. 213) and similarly isolated 
channels are evident in the beard of the bust of Ottavio 
Grimani (Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem, no. 303). The 
beard is not undercut, little thought has been given to its 
meeting with the neck, or to its relationship with the folds of 
drapery_no undercutting has been attempted in these folds 
and their pattern is routine. But these deficiencies are not 
uncommon in Vittoria's signed work, much of which must 
have been carved by assistants of varying quality. Bruce 
Boucher, cataloguing the sculpture in the Arts Council 
exhibition Andrea Palladio 1508-1580 (1975), 133, no. 238, 
comments that
the bust is similar to a number of portraits by Vittoria during the 
1570s and 1580s and is probably the work of a contemporary 
sculptor, well versed in Vittoria's style. The treatment of the high 

forehead, the hair, and the well defined cheekbones invites 

comparison with the terracotta and bronze portraits of Tommaso 
Rangone (in the Museo Correr and the Ateneo Veneto respectively), 
which were probably commissioned from Vittoria in the 1570s.


Theodore de VOGHEL (active 1590s)
105. Stipo in the form of a 
miniature temple decorated with 
scenes from the New Testament and 
the Trojan War
32 cms. (height); 26 cms. (length); 24.6 cms. (breadth)
Rosewood, ivory, and ebony. There are eight small drawers. In 
addition the entire base of the temple facade serves as a drawer and 
the entablature as two drawers. Two secret slides reveal four long 
drawers in the back. Some small pieces of ebony veneer have fallen 
off to proper right near the feet and are preserved in the drawers. 
The rosewood has been quarter cut to give a particularly rich figure. 

The piece of ivory inserted in the centre of the underside of the 
temple is engraved as follows: `THEODORUS / DE~^@ VOGHEL~^@ 
FLA / NDER~^@ SUAE~^@ CATHO: / LICAE~^@ MAIESTATIS / BELLICORUM~^@ 
TORME / NTORUM~^@ MAGISTER~^@ / NEAPOLI~^@ FECIT / 1593'.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum, 1899. Bought by him for Â£30 at 
the sale in 1884 of the Castellani Collection (in Rome? It is not in 

the catalogue of the `Objets antiques du moyenÃ¢ge et de la 
renaissance dÃ©pendant de la succession Alessandro Castellani', sold 

Ho~7tel Drouot, Paris, 12-16 May 1884). F. 21 in Fortnum's 
catalogues. Fortnum purchased another, larger, stipo of ivory and 
ebony from the Castellani Collection (F. 22) which he bequeathed 
to Mrs A. C. King of Oxford.
De Voghel was a master gunsmith for the king of Spain: 
firearms in this period were often ornamented with rosewood 
and engraved ivories. Between 1588 and 1600 he was working 
on the intarsia of the sacristry of the Certosa di San Martino, 
Naples. Had these ivories all been designed for a single stipo 
they surely would not have been such an odd mixture of 
sacred and profane subjects. The scenes on the little drawers 
represent the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the 
Adoration of the Shepherds, the Massacre of the Innocents, the 
Flight, the Lamentation, and Christ disputing with the 
Doctors, with the Adoration of the Kings in the lower frieze 
and God the Father presiding above. There are larger plaques 
engraved with the Judgement of Paris, the Rape of Helen, the 
Flight of Aeneas, and the Gods in Dispute on the sides and 
top of the stipo. Moreover, had the series of New Testament 
scenes been intended as drawer fronts then the artist would 
have taken into account the need for handles. As it is the 
turned ivory handles interrupt the compositions crudely, on 
one occasion obliterating much of the Christ Child. A similar 
stipo was lot 234 at Sotheby's, New York, 22 June 1989.


Factory founded in Via Pudenziana, Rome, by Giovanni 
VOLPATO (1733-1803)
106. Melpomene
28 cms. (height); 1 cm. (height of integral plinth); 10.5 cms. 
(length of integral plinth); 6.95 cms. (width of integral plinth)
Biscuit porcelain badly discoloured from dirt. There is a repaired 
break across the lower part of the mask, the adhesive now 
discoloured brown. Part of her right hand is missing. Her left hand 
is missing and the stump is discoloured with old adhesive. There is 
a slight firing crack across the back of the figure. The front face o 
f 
the plinth is impressed `MELPOMENE'. The proper right face is 
impressed `G. VOLPATO ROMA', the `V' and `R' in larger capitals. A 
relatively clean rectangle to proper left of the impressed name on 
the front face of the plinth indicates the former position of a paper 

label. `C. / 471. / ' is painted in black on the drapery behind the 
figure, above the plinth.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1888. C. 471 in his catalogues. 
presumably acquired after 1857 at which date the preliminary 
catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled.
The statuette is a miniature copy of one of the Muses in the 
Vatican Museum. Fortnum also owned a fullsize copy in 
white marble of the bust of the same antique Muse_see No. 
20. Giovanni Volpato was practising as an engraver in Venice 
before he established himself in 1771 in Rome where he 
engaged in the highly acclaimed production of huge and 
faithfully coloured engravings of Raphael's Loggie 
decorations, produced reproductive prints after Raphael and 
the Caracci, and was involved in speculative excavations of 
sculpture. He opened a factory in 1785 in Via Pudenziana in 
Rome making biscuit porcelain reproductions of antique 
sculpture such as this. The factory moved in 1793 to Strada 
Urbana Monti, Vicolo della Caprareccia 142. A printed 
`Catalogue des Statues antiques, groupes, et Dessert de 
Porcellaine en biscuit, de la Fabrique Jean Volpato a~6 Rome' 
is included among the letters of C. H. Tatham to the architect 
Henry Holland for whom he was acting as an agent in Rome, 
providing items and ideas for interior decoration. `Apollon 
CythÃ©rÃ© avec les neuf Muses du Museum Vaticanum' was 
priced at 40 zecchini (then, approximately, a little under Â£20), 
but each of the ten figures was also available for 4 zecchini. 
Tatham, writing to Holland in 1795, marked the Muses as a 
`very beautiful collection'. He noted that `Madame Angelica', 
that is Angelica Kauffmann, recommended Volpato's ceramic 
figures and that they were of the `whitest porcelain similar to 
the French_but very superior as to design, workmanship and 
art'. In fact the porcelain was not always so white. The version 
of the Melpomene in the Cini Bequest (347) in the Capitoline 
Museum is a slightly pinky yellow colour as are the Euterpe 
and Thalia (but not the Terpsichore and Clio) exhibited in 
the Volpato exhibition in the Gabinetto dei Disegni e Stampe 
in the Farnesina, Rome, January-April 1988.
The Via Pudenziana factory is said to have produced cream 

coloured earthenware as well as biscuit porcelain. The factory 
at Civita~6 Castellana, which was opened in 1801, produced 
coarser and cheaper figures in `terraglia all'Inglese' with a 
glossy yellowish glaze, many of them after the antique. The 
factory was managed by Giuseppe Volpato, who is also said 
to have managed the earlier factories. Giuseppe outlived his 
father only by a couple of years, and the business was then 
managed by his widow Maddalena Righi and her second 
husband, the factory's chief modeller Francesco Tinucci, until 
1818 when it was taken over by Giuseppe's son Angelo who 
managed it until 1831. In addition to the Melpomene and the 
St Joseph (No. 107), Fortnum owned a pair of cream glazed 
vases (C. 467 and C. 468_Nos. 530, 531) and a cream 
glazed oval plaque with a scratchy low relief of the Virgin and 
Child with St John in a landscape setting (C. 469), but these 
are not products of the Volpato factory as he supposed.

Civita~6 Castellana, near Rome
107. St Joseph with the infant 
Christ
27.2 cms. (height), 1.7 cms. (height of integral plinth); 12.7 cms. 
(length of integral plinth); 8.8 cms. (width of integral plinth)
Earthenware with a cream coloured lead glaze, yellowy green where 
thickest (in some folds of drapery), with minor imperfections. Chips 

are missing from the edges of the drapery and the ridges of its 
folds_a large chip from the lower edge above the advanced right 
foot. Losses: the fingers from Christ's left hand, the whole of his 
right arm below the bicep, and the lowest portion of both legs. 
`VOLPATO ROMA' is impressed on the face of the plinth to proper 
left. `C. / 470. / ' is painted in black on the drapery above the 
plinth behind the figure.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1888. C. 470 in his catalogues. A 
separate memorandum among his papers dated 1875 indicates that 
he paid Â£2 10s. for it but where is not stated.
Fortnum described this as `beautifully modelled in the fine 
earthenware' and noted also that the mark `but rarely occurs' 
on such pieces_evidently it appealed to him for both its 
artistic and documentary value. There is another version of 
the figure among the Bequest of Conte F. Cini (displayed 
without a number) in the Capitoline Museum Rome, which 
has the same glaze, also slightly green where thickest, and 
similar minor imperfections. The only significant difference 
is that the plinth of the Capitoline version is far less regular, 
and it is unmarked. The factory produced other devotional 
subjects in this earthenware (for example, the Christ at the 
Column in the Capitoline Museum, impressed like the 
Ashmolean's St Joseph) as well as some classical ones (for 
example, the Cupid and Psyche in the Capitoline Museum). 
For Volpato and his factories see No. 106. St Joseph may 
have had a special significance for the Volpato family: 
Giovanni's son Giuseppe (Joseph), who died in 1805, seems 

to have managed the factory at Civita~6 Castellana where these 
figures were made, and after 1831 Giuseppe II Volpato revived 
the family business, increasing, according to G. Morazzoni 
(La terraglia italiana Milan, n.d. [1956]), 57, the 
manufacture of saints.

108. Pope Pius VI on horseback
35.3 cms. (height, including integral oval plinth); 1.7 cms. (height 

of integral oval plinth); 22 cms. (length of integral oval plinth); 
13.7 cms. (width of integral oval plinth)
Earthenware with a greenish cream coloured lead glaze. The glaze 
is peppered where the granules in the earthenware body project. 
Three breaks in the raised front left of the horse have been mended, 

A crack behind the other front leg has been filled. Some losses to 
the pope's left foot and the stirrup have been made up, and the 
thumb and two raised fingers of his raised hand are also repairs (thi 
s 
was perhaps done soon after the original firing). The reins to proper 

right have broken off except where they fall from the pope's hand; 
parts of the reins to proper left are also lost.
Purchased from the dealer Alfred Spero of 4 Park Mansions Arcade, 
Knightsbridge, 1965. Registered on 22 September.
Pope Pius VI (elected 1775, d. 1799) is here represented as 
he appeared in the processional possesso after his election, 
wearing a mantelletta over his rochet with a mozzetta and 
embroidered stole and hat, riding a (white) palfrey with 
elaborate caparison, blessing his people. The Braschi arms 
decorate the pier supporting the belly of his mount, although 
the bending flower is less distinct than the three stars and the 
wind blowing at the flower is impossible to discern. There is 
another version of the group in the City Museum and Art 
Gallery, Kelvingrove, Glasgow (SMT 101) with a creamier 
colour, less granular texture, and crisper details. The Glasgow 
version is better preserved although the pope's right foot and 
all the tassels of the saddlecloth are missing. Another version 
is mentioned as having been exhibited in 1889 in the Museo 
Artistico Industriale di Roma (G. Morazzoni, La terraglia 
italiana (Milan, n.d. [1956], 57). The group has sometimes 
been associated with the earthenware products of the Civita~6 
Castellana factory which Volpato opened in 1801 but it differs 
in its granular body and the colour of its glaze from 
earthenware figures stamped `VOLPATO' (such as No. 107) 
which one might also suppose to have been made at Civita~6 
Castellana, and by 1801 Pius VI had died. If the group is 
correctly associated with Volpato, as seems very probable, it 
is far more likely to have been made at the Via Pudenziana 
factory which Volpato opened in 1785_especially since this 
enterprise enjoyed the official protection of Pius VI. The 
factory was chiefly noted for its biscuit figures (see No. 106) 

but did also make other wares.
The same model, but with the face and arms of Pius VI's 
successor Pius VII (elected 1800), was employed for a painted 
terracotta in the Victoria and Albert Museum. J. Pope
Hennessy (in his Catalogue of Italian Sculpture in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 1964), ii. 677, no. 
722), unfamiliar with the earlier ceramic statuettes, claimed 
that this terracotta recalls the `sketch models' of Pinelli, but 
these are far more lively in handling and are never heraldic in 
composition (see No. 75). This terracotta may well have been 
produced by the Civita~6 Castellana factory, either shortly after 
its foundation or when the pope returned to the Vatican in 
May 1814.

109. Michelangelo Buonarroti
28 cms. (height from lowest portion of the neck to the top of the 
head); 16 cms. (height of socle to lowest portion of bronze); 
20 cms. (diameter of socle)
Bronze with a dark brown patina. Hollow, lostwax, cast. Walls of 
uneven thickness. There are some minute perforations and a firing 
crack to proper left of the nose. There is no evidence of tooling of 

any kind. The lowest part of the neck has been broken and refixed 
with solder. A skin of the original core remains in much of the 
interior but has been partially concealed by a pouring of modern 
plaster of Paris into the uppermost part of the head. The head is 
mounted on a turned, waisted, and moulded walnut socle made for 
exhibition in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British 
Museum in 1975. (An earlier socle of similar form, but of 
serpentine_and 23.3 cms. high_ is in storage.) In the last century 
the head was mounted on a bust of plaster, presumably bronzed_
see J. C. Robinson, The Drawings by Michel Angelo and Raffaello 
in the University Galleries (Oxford, 1870), 101, no. 90, who 
described this as added `at a recent period'. It can, however, be see 
n 
in an undated engraving of Lawrence's sitting room at 65 Russell 
Square (reproduced as Fig 4 on p. 27 of K. Garlick, Sir Thomas 
Lawrence (Oxford, 1989).
Given by William Woodburn, 1845. Presumably lot 392 in the sale 
of the collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence, Christie's, 19 June 1830, 
`A fine original Bust of Michelangelo Buonarroti in bronze_size of 
life', bought by `Woodburn' (which member of the family is 
unspecified) for the high price of 40 guineas. Conceivably purchased 

by Samuel Woodburn and bequeathed by him to his brother 
William. In any case given to the University Galleries to accompany 
the drawings by Michelangelo, also from Lawrence's collection, 
which had been bought from Samuel Woodburn. The Handbook 
Guides of 1859 and 1865 record it as in the Raffaelle Gallery, the 
present Fortnum Gallery, where the Michelangelo drawings were 
displayed. It seems possible that Lawrence acquired the bust from 
the collection of Richard Cosway in whose inventory of 1820 and 
earlier selfportrait drawing such a bust features (information from 

Stephen Lloyd).
Although Daniele da Volterra is now remembered chiefly for 
his work as a painter, he was, as is clear from Vasari, an active 
and important sculptor. He seems to have made decorations 
in stucco as well as fresco for Cardinal Trivulzi's villa at 
Salone, in a room of Palazzo Massimi in Rome he was 
responsible for `molti partimenti di stucco ed altri ornamenti', 
for the chapel of Elena Orsina in S. Trinita~6, Rome, in 1541 
he created a `most beautiful and varied' stucco surround for 
his celebrated altarpiece of the Deposition including two figures 
supporting the altar frontal. And that this work consisted in 
more than making designs for craftsmen is suggested by the 
fact that he was a skilled maker of casts: Vasari specifically 
mentions that he made moulds of Michelangelo's sculpture 
in the Medici Chapel in S. Lorenzo, Florence. His direct 
experience of bronze casting is also clear: Vasari describes his 
bronze equestrian statue of Henry II of France, in which 
Michelangelo assisted him, but which was not complete at the 
end of 1559 when Pius IV became pope. It is presumably 
because there exists relatively little by him which is not in 
stucco, and because works in stucco are so little esteemed by 
art historians, that he obtains no mention at all in the standard 
survey of Italian sculpture of the sixteenth century (that by 
PopeHennessy).
The inventory of Daniele's house (formerly Michelangelo's) 
made on 5 April 1566 was published by Benvenuto Gasparoni 
in his rare and eccentric periodical miscellany Il Buonarroti 
(vol. iii_but in reality vol. i_ (Rome, 1866), 178-9). 
Among `infinite teste et pezzi di figure di gesso', wax models 
and casts, some specifically connected with the equestrian 
statue, there are listed `una testa con petto di bronzi di 
Michelagnolo bonarroti' and, in another `stanza da basso', 
`due teste di bronzo con petti di Michelangnolo' and, in yet 
another `stanza da basso', `Dua teste di Michelagnolo con 
teste di bronzo', and, in the `stanza di san Pietro', `una testa 
di bronzo di Michelagnolo con busto'. It is clear from this 
that before his death Daniele had made at least six casts of 
Michelangelo's head, of which three were heads alone, three 
included at least a portion of the chest, and one was with a 
proper bust (that is assuming that `con petto' and `con busto' 
are meaningful distinctions). This document has perhaps not 
received the attention it deserves: no other sculptural portrait 
head of the Renaissance before this date is recorded as existing 
in so many versions. It would seem that the sculptor was 
capitalizing on the demand for a likeness of his recently 
deceased friend. Other evidence suggests that he would not 
have regarded these bronze casts as completed. But he might 
already have disposed of some that were.
It would seem that two of the casts were intended for 
Michelangelo's nephew, Lionardo Buonarroti, to whom 
Daniele Leoni wrote on 6 October 1565 that he had reminded 
`Daniello' about them. His own cast was `a buon termine' 
which would make Lionardo want to have his own cleaned_
`di fare rinettare'_that is filed, chiselled, and polished, as 

soon as possible. From this it would seem likely that Daniele 
would have wanted the bronzes to be finished. He was, 
however, ill and he died early in the following year. Lionardo 
was informed by Jacopo del Duca on 18 April about the 
`teste di metallo' which had been cast by `Messer Daniello' 
but needed work `con ciselli et lime', and he was not sure 
that Lionardo would appreciate them as they stood. For his 
part he wanted Lionardo to have `il ritratto della bona 
memoria di missere, non d'un altro'. Lionardo must do what 
he deems best. The implication is that he, Jacopo, would try 
to oblige if Lionardo so desired. `Daniello', had he lived, 
would have known how to finish them, but as for his men_
`questi soi genti', a reference to Daniele's heirs, Michele degli 
Alberti and Feliciano da S. Vita_it was not clear what they 
were capable of. The first of these `genti', Alberti, wrote to 
Lionardo at the same date with word that the bronzes had 
been cast and could be cleaned within a month.
By 26 August 1570 a portrait head was in the hands of 
Michelangelo's servant Antonio del Franzese, who offered it 
in a letter of that date to the duke of Urbino. He described 
it as `il vero ritratto di Michelangnolo Bonarroti gia~6 mio 
padrone, et e~6 di bronzo designato da lui proprio' (A. Gotti, 
Vita di Michelangelo Buonarroti (Florence, 1875), i. 373_
the letters to Lionardo cited above are on pp. 372-3). Of the 
surviving versions of the bronze portrait it is most likely that 
the one in the Museo Nazionale at the Bargello, Florence, 
which is set in a dignified, classically draped, bust on a very 
elegant socle, must be the one offered by Antonio to the 
duke_the treasures of the duchy of Urbino being transferred 
to the Medici in the seventeenth century and then, in the 
nineteenth being absorbed into the state museum. Alone 
among these bronzes it is highly finished. (It has sometimes 
been attributed to Giambologna, whose participation would 
be less unlikely had it been in Florence in his lifetime. 
Giambologna is also credited with the version in the Casa 
Buonarroti.)
The following is a list of the whereabouts of the other 
versions, excluding that in the Ashmolean: Bayonne, MusÃ©e 
Bonnat (No. 345); Florence, Accademia; Florence, Casa 
Buonarroti; Milan, Brera; Milan, Castello Sforzesco (297); 
Rome, Capitoline Museums (Palazzo dei Conservatori); 
Rome, Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Auriti Collection, no. 
10806); Paris, MusÃ©e JacquemartAndrÃ© (no. 141); Paris, 
MusÃ©e du Louvre (R.F. 2385); Rimini, Museo Civico. Of 
these the versions in Casa Buonarroti, the Brera, and the 
Capitoline are fitted with busts, the first two of bronze and 
the third of bigio Morato (antique dark grey cloudy marble). 
The Louvre, Casa Buonarroti, Bayonne, and Palazzo Venezia 
versions are cast with portions of the collar (and that in the 
Capitoline Museums also has such in addition to a bust, 
although it is broken); the JacquemartAndrÃ© and Rimini 
versions include more of the chest, separately cast; the 
Ashmolean and Castello Sforzesco versions are heads only. 
The heads in Rimini and the Bargello have longer and more 

curled beards. The degree of chiselling is varied: none is 
apparent in the Louvre, JacquemartAndrÃ©, Castello 
Sforzesco, or Ashmolean versions; there is some in the 
Capitoline version which has a dull smooth finish (most 
notable in the Beard), much in the Casa Buonarroti version 
and in the Bargello version (as has already been observed). 
That some of the busts are aftercasts seems likely. The 
thorough researches of Fortnum for his paper `On the Bronze 
Portrait Busts of Michel Angelo Attributed to Daniele da 
Volterra and Other Artists', published in Archaeological 
Journal, 33 (1876), 168-82, includes measurements of the 
Capitoline, Casa Buonarroti, Bargello, Accademia, Louvre 
(then Piot), JacquemartAndrÃ© (then Cottier) heads which 
suggest that none of these fall into this category. The version 
in Rimini looks suspicious (it is reproduced in E. Steinmann, 
Die Portraitstellungen des Michelangelo (Leipzig, 1913), pl. 
59). That in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan, looks as if it must 
have been made from a very battered wax model, perhaps 
after Daniele's death (ibid. 61). Its surface is very rough and 
imprecise: the moustache is very smudged and neither pupils 
nor irises are marked.
The fact that Fortnum took such an interest in these 
bronzes may seem curious. It reflects, of course, his own 
interest in the collections in Oxford and, still more perhaps, 
the fact that the bronze now in the Louvre, but then 
belonging to Monsieur Piot, had been purchased `from a 
private possessor at Bologna, several years since, in whose 
hands I had previously seen it, and regret, too late, having 
neglected to secure it for my own collection' (Fortnum, op. 
cit. 176). Fortnum also owned the wax model made by Leone 
Leoni for his medallion portrait of Michelangelo (now British 
Museum, MLA 1893, 1011, 1; one of a few important items 
which he gave to the British Museum rather than to Oxford 
and the subject of another paper in the Archaeological Journal, 
32 (1875), 1-15, which is preliminary to the paper on the 
bronze busts).
Robinson observed of Daniele's portrait that it `represents 
Michel Angelo in his extreme old age, and it seems to have 
been modelled from nature' (op. cit. 101). Fortnum agreed 
with this but the `heavy look of the eyelids and the closed 
mouth' suggested to him that it `may have been made from 
a mask taken after death'. Both `Mr. Warrington Wood, the 
eminent sculptor of Rome' and `Professor Emilio Santarelli, 
a sculptor well known to fame, and whose knowledge, arising 
from long and loving study of the works of the great 
renaissance artists, is perhaps unrivalled in Florence' (see Nos. 
8 and 27 for his dealings with Fortnum) both independently 
expressed the same opinion to Fortnum. It is an opinion 
which receives some support from the evidence that most, 
and probably all, of the portraits were cast posthumously and 
it has been repeated ever since. However, the flesh is neither 
drawn nor sagged, the features are not sunk, the eyes seem 
open (rather than opened), and, above all, the portrait is 
surely not of someone in their `extreme' old age. The head 

resembles one in a drawing by Daniele in the Teyler Museum, 
Haarlem (A. 21), which was made, or was at least used, for 
the portrait of Michelangelo inserted into a fresco of the 
Assumption of the Virgin in the Della Rovere Chapel of S. 
Trinita~6 dei Monti, and probably completed by 1555. (For this 
drawing see the entry by P. WardJackson in Drawings from 
the Teyler Museum, Haarlem (Victoria and Albert Museum, 
London, 1970), no. 75.)
It is likely, however, that Daniele's portraits were revered 
rather as deathmasks were_as reliable likenesses not works 
of art_and this may explain why so few of them were in the 
end finished. It is tempting of course to suppose that despite 
the evidence of the contemporaty letters which we have 
quoted_letters which were, after all, written by people with 
an interest in finishing the bronzes_the lack of finish, the 
untooled lostwax cast, was then appreciated by some 
connoisseurs. Certainly the ostentatiously untooled character 
of Giambologna's Monkey (MusÃ©e du Louvre, OA. 10895) 
and Turkey (Bargello, Florence) and of Vincenzo Danti's 
Descent from the Cross (National Gallery, Washington) 
suggests that such connoisseurs did exist. We may, however, 
be sure that Michelangelo was not himself among them, for 
Ascanio Condivi in his authorized life remarks apropos of 
Donatello's work in bronze that Michelangelo praised 
Donatello for everything except that he lacked patience in the 
cleaning (ripulir) of his works so that, though seeming 
marvellous from afar, from nearby they lost their reputation' 
(Vita di Michelangelo (Rome, 1553), para. 20).
Some of the casts Daniele made included the `petto' and 
in one case perhaps more. It is likely that the portion of 
buttonedup tunic which is part of the JacquemartAndrÃ© cast 
(F. de la MoureyreGavoty, Sculpture italienne: MusÃ©e 
JaquemartAndrÃ© (Paris, 1975), no. 141) would be described 
as a `petto' rather than a `busto'. (It is separately cast but 
surely original: although now joined with solder there are old 
metal strap attachments.) In any case such a termination, 
which would at a later date have been unconventionally 
modest, corresponds with the unheroic, even domestic, 
character of the head. In this case, as also in the very different 
setting of the bust in the Capitoline Museum, the head is 
tilted forward which gives an appropriate melancholy to the 
lack of explicit expression and suggests a setting high on a 
wall, even above a door, such as was frequently favoured in 
fifteenth and early sixteenthcentury interiors. By contrast 
the manner in which the Ashmolean head has been mounted 
is unfortunate. A turned socle for a head without a neck is 
inevitably perceived as a sort of parody neck.

Bronze with a patina varied from very dark brown to chestnut with 
some dark green. The plinths and upper mouldings of the pedestals 
are firegilt. Hollow, lostwax, casts. Each vase is composed of at 
least three separately cast pieces_cap; body with foot and plinth; 
pedestal. There may also be a division between the bodies and the 
feet. There are slight casting flaws under the top moulding of the 
stem of one foot. `G.Z.F.' is chiselled in the sides of the plinths o

the vases, in one case below a handle, in the other centred.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 1124 and B. 1125 in

181).
Giacomo Zoffoli was a goldsmith, established in Rome by 
1758. Giovanni (his brother, cousin, or nephew) and he came 
to be one of the four principal suppliers in Rome of bronze 
reproductions of antique statues: Righetti and Boschi were 
two of their rivals (see Nos. 15-16, 79-81). The Zoffolis 
seem chiefly to have supplied sets of bronzes of a size suited 
to display as chimneypiece ornaments. The earliest work 
associated with them is the copy of the Marcus Aurelius 
signed by Giacomo and dated 1763 (in the Green vaults, 
Dresden) and the set of five bronzes brought back to England 
by Francis Russell, marquess of Tavistock, from his Grand 
Tour in the same year (C. Avery, `Bronze Statuettes in 
Woburn Abbey', Apollo (Feb. 1984), 97-8). British travellers 
on the Grand Tour were certainly among the principle 
customers (see The Treasure Houses of Great Britain
(National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, 1985), 358, entry 
by
A. Radcliffe). There is no need to suppose that either of the 
Zoffolis was directly involved either in the making of models, 
or in the business of casting or finishing the bronzes, although 
a background as goldsmiths suggests that they might have 
been expert at the latter. It is safer to regard them as 
publishers. We know that they commissioned clay models 
from established Roman sculptors: Vincenzo Pacetti recorded 
in his diaries in 1773 and 1774 making a Farnese Flora and a 
Borghese Hermaphrodite. They may then have put the task of 
making casts out to small Roman foundries.
There is a printed list of `Serie di figure fatte, e da farsi in 
bronzo dell'altezza di un palmo e mezzo bono romano' offered 
for sale by `Giovanni Zoffoli Romano' (whose home and 
`studio'_i.e. showroom_was given as above the 
`Vermicellaro alli Avinionesi', the pasta makers in Via degli 
Avignonesi off Strada Felice in Rome, an impossible location, 
incidentally, for a foundry, as Anthony Radcliffe has pointed 
out to me. A copy of this was supplied by C. H. Tatham to 
Henry Holland in 1795, and survives among his papers in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum. Tatham was acting as Holland's 
agent in Rome, supplying him with ideas and items for interior 
decoration. Zoffoli's list included seven vases_the Medici 
Vase, the Borghese Vase, the Albani Vase, the Giustiniani 

Vase, the Gaeta Vase, and two which would seem to have 
been modern designs, a `vaso a urna' and a `vaso a Pila'. This 
pair being closed with lids, are likely to be the former, which 
were priced at 20 zecchini (then a little less than Â£10) each. 
The shape is close to that of the Medici Vase but with handles 
like those of the Borghese Vase. The designer is not known.

446 in his catalogues. No provenance given in his large or his 
notebook catalogue, but in his preliminary catalogue (pp. 30-40) 
noted as acquired in Paris together with No. 113, the copy of the 
Apollino, in 1853. According to a separate `Memoranda of prices 
paid', apparently under the year 1852, `2 Zoffolis. Flora and 
Apollino' are entered with `6' (pounds, presumably) opposite.
For the famous antique statue in the Museo Nazionale, 
Naples, of which this is a copy see F. Haskell and N. Penny, 
Taste and the Antique (New Haven, Conn., and London, 
1981), 217-18. The bronze reproduces the statue before the 
revision (by Tagliolini, see No. 98) of the floral attribute from 
chaplet to nosegay. It is probably derived from a clay model 
made for the Zoffolis by Vincenzo Pacetti in 1773, and in any 
case certainly from a model made before 28 February 1800 
when the statue left Rome for Naples. For the Zoffolis 
generally see Nos. 110 and 111. The `Flora di Farnese' was 
the twelfth item on Giovanni Zoffoli's printed list and was 
priced at 18 zecchini, the same price as the equivalent on the 
list of his rival Righetti. The model was surely made before 
1793 when another bronze was probably acquired by Lord 
Boringdon as part of a set still in place on a chimneypiece at 

Saltram Park, Devon, where it is companion with a Capitoline 
Flora. Another bronze Farnese Flora is at Schloss WÃ¶rlitz. 
The green varnish on the Ashmolean's version would seem 
to be original and is found on other bronzes by Zoffoli such 
as the Capitoline Antinous in the Victoria and Albert Museum 
(Reserve Collection, A. 151974), which appears to have been 
very little interferred with and even retains what may be an 
original paper label, and the pair of Furietti Centaurs, 
unusually signed `GIACOMO ZOFFOLI F', which were lot 112 
at Christie's, London, 28 April 1988. C. H. Tatham in a letter 
to Henry Holland sent from Rome on 10 July 1795 discussing 
bronzes of this type mentions that the `best colour' in Rome 
was `esteemed to be that which approaches the colour of 
green basalt' (Victoria and Albert Museum, D. 1479. 14-
19), i.e. the rare Egyptian graywacke, basanite, commonly 
misdescribed as basalt.

Florence, of which this is a copy, see F. Haskell and
N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (New Haven, Conn., and 
London, 1981), 146-8. The bronze is made from a very 
accurate model and even reproduces the integral irregular 
roundedoff rectangular plinth on the original marble, 
although this did nothing to help the figure match the 
companion pieces with which it would usually be sold to 
form a garniture de cheminÃ©e. For the Zoffolis generally see 

Nos. 110 and 111. The Apollino was the second item on 
Giovanni Zoffoli's printed list and was priced at 15 zecchini, 
three zecchini less than the equivalent on the list of his rival 
Righetti, and less than other items of the same size on his 
own list. The lower price may suggest that it had been in 
production for some time and the title `Apollino di Villa 
Medici' may suggest that the model was made before the 
statue was removed to Florence from the Villa Medici in 
1769-70 (although the old name no doubt survived on the 
plaster casts remaining in Rome).

as acquired in London together with the Capitoline Flora (No. 115)

For the famous antique statue in the Capitoline Museum, 
Rome, of which this is a copy, see F. Haskell and N. Penny, 
Taste and the Antique (New Haven, Conn., and London, 
1981), 143-4. The bronze is made from a less accurate model 
than was usual with Zoffoli: the third, fourth, and fifth fingers 
of the youth's left hand are bent upwards in the marble; the 
bark of the stump is given a far more ostentatiously lively, 
clawed texture in the bronze. On the other hand, as seems 
to have been a policy with Zoffoli, the integral unmoulded 
block plinth of the original marble is reproduced, although 
this did nothing to help the figure match the companion 
pieces with which it would usually be sold to form a garniture 
de cheminÃ©e. For the Zoffolis generally see Nos. 110 and 111. 

The `Antinoo di Campidoglio' was the third item on Giovanni 
Zoffoli's printed list and was priced at 15 zecchini, three 
zecchini less than the equivalent on the list of his rival Righetti. 

The model must have been made by 1769 when one was 
included on the chimneypiece in the drawing room where 
Sir Laurence Dundas sits with his grandson in the portrait by 
Johann Zoffany, its companion (at some distance) being the 
Borghese Gladiator. Another version of this bronze is in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 151974).
The `F.' terminating the name on this bronze and the 
initials on the vases (Nos. 110-11) may have been 
misinterpreted by Fortnum who, in his manuscript catalogues 
and his introduction to the Catalogue of Bronzes in the South 
Kensington Museum, supposed that Zoffoli was Florentine.

For the famous antique statue in the Capitoline Museum, 
Rome, of which this is a copy, see F. Haskell and N. Penny, 
Taste and the Antique (New Haven, Conn., and London, 
1981), 215-17. The bronze is made from a very accurate 
model and even reproduces the integral oval hollowed base 
of the original marble, although this did nothing to help the 
figure match the companion pieces with which it would usually 
be sold to form a garniture de cheminÃ©e. For the Zoffolis 
generally see Nos. 110 and 111. The `Flora di Campidoglio' 
was the thirteenth item on Giovanni Zoffoli's printed list and 
was priced at 16 zecchini, two zecchini less than the equivalent 
on the list of his rival Righetti. It is interesting that the 
amount paid by Fortnum was not much beneath its original 
price (which would have been equivalent to slightly less than 
Â£7). The model for this figure was surely made before 1793 
when another bronze was probably acquired by Lord 
Boringdon as part of a set still in place on a chimneypiece at 
Saltram Park, Devon, companion with a Farnese Flora. It is 

interesting that the two Floras in Fortnum's collection (this 
and No. 112) have the same type of marble plinth. If these 
were fitted by Fortnum one would expect to find them on 
his other bronzes by Zoffoli.

116. Bust of St Genevie~6ve
38.6 cms. (height); 31 cms. (width)
Carrara marble discoloured brown from ingrained dust. There is a 
small flaw in the marble above the saint's left eye with some 
discoloured plaster filling in it and there is a grey fleck in the fi 
gure's 
chest. The medallion of Christ around the figure's neck has been 
gilded: some of the gilding has been rubbed off. The edges of the 
relief are neat enough from in front, but have been coarsely hewn 
when studied from behind. There is a corner of the relief missing 
behind the head to the proper left before the arched top, and there 
are traces of plaster cement on the edges. The relief is set with cru 
de 
supports in a framework of pine coated with gesso with a punched 
pattern which has been gilded and then covered with a thin ebonized 
veneer much of which has been broken off.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum, 20 March 1888, and given later in the 
same year. S. 54 in his catalogues. Bought at the sale of the collect 
ion 
of Alexander Nesbitt on 19 May 1887 for 38 guineas (notebook 
catalogue).
The relief has generally been described in the Department's 
files as representing the youthful St John but sometimes as a 
young woman. If St John is intended it is curious that the 
drapery over his left shoulder is not of goatskin and the cap 
is also unusual for him or any other young male saint. Much 
the most likely subject is St Genevie~6ve the shepherd girl (born 
in Nanterre in 421) who at the age of about 7 was given a 
small copper coin marked with the sign of the cross by 
St Germain, bishop of Auxerre. It is unusual for her medallion 
to have the head of Christ rather than a cross on it and it is 
also a surprising subject for an Italian artist, but Fortnum is 
known to have owned a bust of this saint, and although he 
described it as of St Genevie~6ve of Brabant this was a common 
mistake for St Genevie~6re of Nanterre. He acquired the 
sculpture from the collection of Alexander Nesbitt who 
believed that it has `formed part of the old facade of the 
Duomo at Florence' and attributed it to one of the pupils of 
Orcagna (Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, 2nd series 
8 (23 June 1881), 547) and thus dated it to the late fourteenth 
or early fifteenth century.
The odd shape of the relief, with curved lower edge and 
sraight tapering sides stepped back to the arched top, either 
suggests, or is designed to suggest, that it is a fragment. At 

the same time the cutting of the chest and upper arms recalls 
the type of termination common in fifteenthcentury 
Florentine busts of women and children, and in particular 
busts of the infant Christ and Saint John. The miniature drill 
holes in the hair_and the single drill hole in the corner of 
the figure's right eye_may also be inspired by genuine 
fifteenthcentury Florentine reliefs (such as the relief of the 
young Baptist in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
which `looks as though it had been through a sewing 
machine'_J. PopeHennessy, The Study and Criticism of 
Italian Sculpture (Princeton, NJ, 1980), 224-5, fig. 5). 
Certainly the insipid religiosity and parted lips are inspired by 
the tender sentiment and evanescent expression found in the 
domestic devotional works by sculptors such as Mino da 
Fiesole and Desiderio da Settignano. Whether the sculpture 
is a pastiche or a fake is impossible to say, but it is likely to 
have been made in Florence in the 1860s or 1870s. The 
drilling and the religiosity are reminiscent of Bastianini's bust 
of Lucrezia Donati (Victoria and Albert Museum 381869) 
trumpeted as a masterpiece of Mino until exposed as a fake 
by the dealer Alessandro Foresi in 1868. Fortnum must have 
been acutely aware of this controversy but he certainly did 
not doubt the authenticity of this piece. Bell in his annotations 
to the large catalogue recorded Schubring's opinion that it 
was by Nanni di Banco and Bode's that it was modern. It 
was on display in the Fortnum Room together with other 
reliefs (e.g. Nos. 26 and 27) in 1909 but was not included 
in the newly arranged Fortnum Room in 1931 (Summary 
Guide, 23).

set behind glass inside a deep oval shadow box with an oak frame 
and a deep, concave, slip also of oak but water gilded. There are 
splits in the frame and slip.
Given by J. M. Dent_presumably Joseph Malaby Dent (1849-
1926), the successful publisher_in 1903. Deceptively described as 
a `print of the death mask' in the Annual Report for that year 
(p. 10).
It is likely that this cast of the deathmask of Lorenzo
de'Medici (1449-92), as it was generally believed to be, was 
felt to be an appropriate possession for the Ashmolean 
Museum because of the terracotta portrait of Lorenzo which 
Fortnum had presented to the Museum in 1888 having 
bought it from Emilio Santarelli, the Florentine sculptor, 
expert, collector, and dealer in 1870. (Fortnum indeed 
believed that the head was based on such a mask.) The mask 
was on receipt `framed and placed close to the terracotta bust 
in the Fortnum Collection for purposes of comparison' 
(Annual Report (1903), 10) but by 1909 according to the 

Handbook Guide (p. 101) the bust was displayed with a 
photograph of the mask in the possession of the Societa~6 
Columbaria in Florence and the cast was presumably in the 
basement store whence it seems never to have been removed.

118. Pacing horse (Horse of St 
Mark's)
28 cms. (height of horse); 28.2 cms. (length of horse, nose to 
heel); 6 cms. (height of plinth); 26.5 cms. (length of plinth); 
11 cms. (width of plinth)
Bronze with a dark brown to black varnish extensively worn to reveal 

a slightly olive green brown natural patina. The centres of the 
rosettes and the studs between them on the collar are of silver, whic 
h 
has tarnished. The eyes are hollowed perhaps for silver inserts which 

have fallen out. Hollow, lostwax, cast with thin walls. The nostrils 

and mouth open into the interior of the cast. The rear portion of the 

tail where it curves has been added with extreme care. The line of 
the join is hard to see but the small heads of the four iron pins are 

betrayed by slight rust. There are small perforations in the horse's 

back which have been stopped with wax and one lozengeshaped 
hole 0.4 cms. across. There is a larger lozengeshaped hole, 0.8 cms. 

across, presumably from a chaplet, in the belly which is not plugged. 

All the details seem to be reproduced from the wax model. The 
bronze is attached to its plinth with two bolts extending from the 
horse's front right and back left hoofs. The small pile of earth 
supporting the horse's back right foot is made of mahogany toned 
to match the bronze. The plinth is of mahogany with the key pattern 
inlaid in satinwood. A small portion of the inlay at the edge of the 

front face has been lost. `M. 177' is written in black ink in the 
interior of the plinth.
Bequeathed by J. Francis Mallet who died 7 January 1947. Received 
in the Museum during the last week of May 1947. No. 177 in the 
inventory of his bequest. Valued by Mallet at Â£30. `Christie' given 
as the only provenance in Mallet's own list. The British eighteenth
century base suggests that it had been for more than 150 years in 
this country.
Mallet described this as `A bronze horse walking with left 
forefoot raised. Style of John de Bologna. Circa 1650. On 
wooden pedestal with key pattern inlay, 18th century, 
English.' In view of his reference to Giambologna Mallet 
perhaps meant to write 1550 rather than 1650. It seems 
perfectly possible that it was made as early as 1550, and might 
have been made as early as 1500, and the silver inlay would 
be less surprising at either of these dates than in 1650 or 

1750. In any case it is likely to have been made in the Veneto 
for it is in fact, as Mallet surprisingly did not note, a 
reproduction of one of the four famous antique bronze horses 
of St Mark's in Venice (for a general account of the history 
and fame of which see F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and 
the Antique (London and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 236-
40). The antique horse reproduced is the one on the 
beholder's right and the imitation of the pattern of the collar, 
the veins on the nostrils, the creases on the neck, the breaks 
in the clipped mane, and the skimpy arched tail is all 
remarkably precise. The cast is of superb quality: all the detail, 
which is remarkably crisp, seems to have been made in the 
model. What looks like another cast with a dull patina but all 
the same details in the modelling and even with an identical 
hole in the belly is on loan to the Royal Ontario Museum, 
Toronto (at present in reserve). One in the collection at 
Schloss Pommersfelden may be a third, although there are 
minor differences (this example is reproduced by H. R. 
Weihrauch in his Europa~8ische Bronzestatuetten (Brunswick, 
1967), 50, pl. 48, captioned as Venetian of the seventeenth 
century). There exist other bronze versions of other horses in 
the quartet which are less precise as copies, less detailed in 
modelling, less accomplished as casts, and often smaller in 
size. One such in the Ashmolean Museum, coming from the 
collection of Chambers Hall, is modelled on the first horse of 
the four on the beholder's left, another, also modelled on 
this same horse, is in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore 
(Weihrauch, op. cit. 50, pl. 47, and E. P. Bowron, 
Renaissance Bronzes in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore 
(Baltimore, Md., 1978), 30-1), but these have usually been 
regarded as probably Venetian or Paduan works of the first 
half of the sixteenth century.
The distinctive manner in which the repair is made to the 
tail of the Ashmolean's horse with the extra piece of bronze 
attached with four minute iron pins (see above) may help to 
identify where and when it was made.



119 and 120. Pair of reclining 
female personifications
7.6 cms. (height of 119, figure leaning on a book, from socle to 
top of head); 14 cms. (length of same figure, from extended foot 
to the large book); 8.2 cms. (height of 120, figure with anchor, 
from socle to raised hand); 16.5 cms. (length of figure with 
anchor); 2.5 cms. (height of socles); 16.75 cms. (length of socles); 

7.2 cms. (width of socles)
Bronze, heavily firegilt, with the gilding worn in the knee and inde 
x 
finger of the right hand of the figure with a book (119) to expose 
a natural patina, warm chocolate in colour, suggesting a high copper 

content. Hollow, lostwax, casts. The casts are heavy and the limbs 

and heads appear to be solid. Both the figures have been minutely 
tooled on both sides, although the rear view is obviously subordinate 
. 
The hair, drapery folds, and fingers are precisely chiselled and a 
punch has been employed to texture the outside of the drapery. In 
both figures there are small areas of tarnishing and also some dirt i 
n 
the deeper hollows. In the case of No. 119 there is a flaw in her 
right foot which has probably been caused by the bolt penetrating 
it. The loss has been filled with red wax. The folio volume is dented 

on the visible cover and flawed on the concealed one. It is cast 
together with the figure but the quarto volume upon which the 
folio rests is cast separately and screwed to it. The quarto volume 
has not been gilded and must be a later addition or a replacement. 
In the case of No. 120 there is a large empty bolt hole in the draper 
y 
spread behind the figure's left foot. The figure's raised hand has 
been separately cast. The joint is slightly loose and the hand is now 

turned with the palm facing to the front whereas it was intended to 
face away from her head. Both figures are bolted to spreading 
rectangular white marble plinths. These are not original and the 
figures do not (when seen from the rear) fit neatly onto them. The 
edges of the plinths have been slightly chipped. Three of the corners 

in one case and two in the other have been made up with plaster. 
`FRANCE / BEQUEST / PURCHASE / 1935' is written in ink on fringed 
circular labels stuck to the underside of each plinth.
Bought from the dealers `Cecil Leitch and Kerin' together with the 
boys riding lions attributed to Roccatagliata (Nos. 124 and 125) 
with fund from the bequest of George Flood France. Recorded in 
the Donations Book on 30 April 1935.
On acquisition these figures were tentatively attributed to 
Guglielmo della Porta on account of the reclining female 
personifications of somewhat similar character on the 
sarcophagus in that sculptor's tomb for Pope Paul III in 
St Peter's. A more likely location for figures in these positions 
would be the sides of a pediment_for there are miniature 
pediments, for example on luxury cabinets in ebony with 
marble inlay and marble columns taking the form of temples 
and on aedicular picture frames, whereas minature sarcophagi 
are harder to imagine. If these little bronzes were attached 
to a pediment and the pediment was broken and filled with 
an achievement of arms then that would explain the 
outstretched arm of the figure with an anchor, especially if 
the original position of the hand is borne in mind (see above).
Larger and less precisely finished versions of these figures, 
slightly adapted in pose (the version of the second figure with 
neither an anchor nor a raised arm), both about 14 cms. in 
length, were attached to the broken pediment of a spectacular 
night clock with a copper face painted with the Fates by 
Filippo Lauri and the body inlaid with semiprecious stones 
and bristling with ormolu fittings, which was made in about 

1660 for Prince Colonna. This clock was, early in 1987, in 
the possession of the dealer Raffaello Amati (of Antiquus, 90-
2 Pimlico Road, London SW1). The figures are likely to have 
been invented long before 1660 and one would be inclined 
to date the Ashmolean's bronzes to the last decades of the 
sixteenth century. The unknown sculptor was an artist of great 
ability. The figures, especially when seen from the side, their 
feet nearest us, are most elegantly composed.
The use of reclining figures on pediments is not common 
in antiquity (although they were of course frequently 
employed in the spandrels of arches) and is not usual in the 
first half of the sixteenth century or before (although 
Donatello introduced the idea in his tabernacle of the 
Sacrament in St Peter's in the 1430s). It was a motif which 
was favoured by Palladio from 1550 onwards and it became 
popular first in the Veneto and then all over Europe.
No. 120, the figure with an anchor (one prong of which, 
incidentally, emerges behind the figure's left foot), 
presumably represents Hope. Her companion with a folio is 
less easily identified. She probably held another attribute in 
her right hand. If this was a Cross then she would represent 
Faith.
There is an inferior version, perhaps an aftercast of the 
Hope (but without the anchor), in the collection of bronzes 
in the Museo Bardini in Florence (unlabelled).


121. Winged female personification
25 cms. (height including integral base); 13 cms. (width, across 
wings); 3.5 cms. (height of base); 7.55 cms. (length of base); 
6.45 cms. (width of base)
Bronze with a dull slightly olive, pale brown patina and traces of a 

gilt varnish (not firegilding) especially in the folds of the draper 
y 
behind the legs and on the figure's right knee. Hollow, presumably 
lostwax, cast. The details are apparently reproduced from the model 

and tooling is evident only at the tips of the wings. There are small 

round perforations at two points in the drapery beside the proper 
left leg, probably from chaplet pins. The interior of the base has 
been filled with plaster of Paris. Both hands have been separately 
cast. The proper left hand is slightly loose and the join at this wri 
st 
may be easily discerned, whereas the join at the other wrist is not a 
t 
all obvious. The attribute in the proper left hand has a screw fittin 
g 
within. It is clear that this object has been broken off under the 
hand and traces of solder remain from an attempted refixing. `B. 433. 

.' is painted in white vertically in one of the hollows of the draper 
y 

behind the figure. A paper label with `B / 433' written in brown ink 

within a printed blue border is stuck to the underside of the base.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 7 January 1888 and given later in the 
same year. B. 433 in his catalogues. `Bought in Florence' according 
to the notebook catalogue, presumably after 1857 when his 
preliminary catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled.
The bronze was accidentally damaged in 1965 and repaired 1965-6
by the conservation studio of the Department of Antiquities.
Fortnum catalogued this figure as an `angel or Ceres' but with 
question marks. Given the separate casting, and hence 
possible replacement, of both hands, the attributes may not 
determine the figure's original identity. `The ears of corn and 
the cup (now incomplete) may be original but injured and 
restored', Fortnum continued carefully. `They may have been 
emblems of Ceres or of bread and wine.' Whereas corn is 
certainly held in the figure's right hand it is not certain that 
the item in the other is, or rather was, a cup.
If the attributes are removed and the figure's right shoulder 
is twisted forwards this figure is seen to relate very closely to 
a bronze statuette which is known in many versions all of 
more or less the same size. These Victories have long been 
recognized as probably derived from an antique prototype 
(see for instance W. Bode, Italian Renaissance Statuettes 
(London, 1908), ii, pl. CII). No such prototype has, however, 
been identified. Figures of a similar character stand at the 
corners of a Roman sarcophagus of AD 180 in the Walters 
Art Gallery, Baltimore (23.29), but since this was excavated 
in 1885 it cannot be the source, which one would, in any 
case, expect to be a freestanding figure. It may be that the 
Ashmolean's bronze is independently derived from the 
unidentified antique source. It looks likely to be more faithful 
to it than are the other versions all of which are more twisted. 
The hexagonal base with stepped mouldings is very unusual 
in a Renaissance bronze: it is a type of base favoured in British 
sculpture around 1890 (see for instance No. 504).
Fortnum regarded his bronze as Italian of the fiftenth 
century. No one would now favour such an early date. Charles 
Avery published a version of the statuette in an American 
private collection (Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the 
Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 
no. 195), for which he ingeniously proposed an attribution 
to Pietro Francavilla (Pierre Francheville) because of its 
similarities with a statuette held by that sculptor in his portrait 
of 1598 by Paggi (published by M. Fransolet, `Une \~uvre 
d'art retrouvÃ©e: Le Portrait de Pierre de Francheville par 
Giambatista Paggi, 1589', Bulletin de l'Institut Historique 
Belge de Rome, 18 (1937), 199-207). But Francavilla's 
statuette, described by Baldinucci (who at one time owned 
it) as `a model, apparently in wax, representing Fame', is 
blowing a trumpet, has drapery blown back to reveal both 
lower legs, seems to have both breasts bare, and does not 
have wings.
The very tight torsion found in the Victory statuettes other 

than the Ashmolean's was popular generally in Italy around 
1600: one finds it in the caryatid figures of Painting and 
Architecture which flank the bust of Alessandro Vittoria on 
his tomb in S. Zaccaria, Venice, and in the four caryatids by 
Ippolito Buzio and Pompeo Ferrucci supporting the attic of 
the tomb of Pope Paul V in the Cappella Paolina in S. Maria 
Maggiore, Rome.
Nevertheless the Victory, if not the Ashmolean's bronze, is 
likely to be a Florentine invention. A diminutive version of 
the figure serves as a finial on a bronze standard lamp in the 
Museum fu~8r Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt on Main (inv. 
no. V218) which is inscribed `FERDINANDUS MEDICES 
MAGNUS ETRURIAE DUX' (a connection noted independently 
by Volker Krahn). A statuette of the same size and pose as 
the Victory statuettes, but gilded and holding a platter of fruit 
or vegetables in her left hand and some vegetation aloft in her 
right, and without wings, is cradled in one hand by a man in 
a portrait attributed to Pontormo, and certainly Florentine, 
in the Christ Church Picture Gallery (J. Byam Shaw, 
Paintings by Old Masters at Christ Church Oxford (Oxford, 
1967), 61, no. 63, pl. 60). The man's other hand rests on a 
companion statuette which is based on Andrea del Sarto's 
fresco of Hope in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, or just possibly 
on a sculptural source used by Sarto who was much indebted 
to models made by his friend Jacopo Sansovino. The 
connection beween the statuette cradled in this painting and 
the Victory was noted independently by Peter Meller who has 
convincingly identified the sitter as Vincenzo Borghini and 
suggested that the statuette may be by Tribolo and derived 
from the Victories which Michelangelo proposed for the first 
project for the tomb of Julius II.
Various distinctions may be made among the bronze 
Victories. Of those that I have studied the version in the Ca 
d'Oro in Venice (D. br. 57) is by far the finest cast. In this 
version her left hand is empty but her right hand holds aloft 
a laurel crown. The undergarment buttoned over the thigh 
and falling down behind the legs, also emerging in a small 
fold under the exposed breast, is given a minutely punched 
texture. The hem of the upper garment lifts and ripples. The 
version in the Louvre (OA. 6415) is also of high quality with 
particularly lively modelling in the front of the wings (but 
much less interest in the drapery). There is no diadem in this 
case but it may have been attached for there is a small hole 
in the hair. The same applies to the bronze in an American 
private collection published by Charles Avery in the 
Giambologna catalogue (cited earlier) which would seem to 
be the version sold at auction at Weinmu~8ller, Munich, 28-
9 October 1970, lot 622. This is very close to the French 
version. Another good example, without wings and without 
a diadem, is in a private collection in Berlin (formerly in the 
collection of the architect Adolf Wollenberg, and sold at 
auction by Rudolph Lepke, 17 March 1982, no. 90, p. 19). 
Of less high quality are the examples in the collection of Sir 
Brinsley Ford, that formerly in the collection of Guido von 

Rho~6 (E. W. Braun, Die Bronzen der Sammlung Guide von 
Rho~6 in Wien (Vienna, 1908), 18, pl. XXb), in the 
Kunsthistorishes Museum, Vienna (5653), and the one in 
the Victoria and Albert Museum (71.1866)_which may be 
an aftercast.

122. Roman warrior riding a camel
7 cms. (height excluding the tangs); 1.6 cms. (length of tangs)
Silver gilt, the gilding worn to expose a tarnished silver. Hollow, 
lostwax, cast. Finely and minutely tooled. There is a circular 
aperture between the camel's front legs. Threaded tangs extend from 
each foot of the canel. The slab of lapis lazuli to which the camel 
was attached has not been traced. The end of the camel's tail has 
been broken off and is lost.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894. Not in his large and 
notebook catalogues, but listed among `objects sent to new rooms 
of Ashmolean Museum October 1894' in a separate notebook 
without a number. Acquired before 1857 when recorded in his 
preliminary catalogue (p. 65). On the separate MS sheet of 
`Memoranda of Prices paid' Fortnum noted `Silver camel C. cento 
1 scudi', converting the `1 scudi' (sic) as 4 shillings.
Fortnum described this as Italian cinquecento work. It is not 
dissimilar in character to No. 123 and was perhaps also made 
as a cabinet ornament. A date in the seventeenth century is 
as likely as one in the sixteenth.

123. Warrior in Roman armour with a wolf beside him
6.5 cms. (height, excluding tang); 1.1 cms. (length of tang)
Bronze of a very high copper content, firegilt in the front, worn to 

expose a natural chocolate coloured patina in parts of the wolf, the 

proper right arm, and proper left hand; the ungilded bronze behind 
with the same patina. Partially hollow, lostwax, cast. There are 
traces of solder behind the seat. There is a large hole behind the 
figure's waist, smaller ones below it and in the proper left shoulder 
. 
The integral irregular plate base was probably intended to continue 
below the proper right foot. A threaded tang extends from below 
the figure's left foot by which it was attached to a slab of cipollin 
o 
rosso marble (which replaced one of red breccia) which has not been 
traced. These are traces of black painted letters along the back of 
the figure.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 7 January 1888 and given by him later 
in the same year. B. 417 in his catalogues. No provenance or date 
of acquisition are given in his catalogues, but it was presumably 
acquired after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it was 
not included, was compiled.
Fortnum catalogued this bronze as Italian of the sixteenth 
century and as a `cleverly model'd ornament' for a `Cabinet 
or some other piece of furniture' with which it is hard to 
disagree_although it might perhaps be seventeenth century 

in date. Fortnum wondered whether the wolf might indicate 
that the figure represented Romulus or might be an attribute 
of Rome. It is not, however, certain that it represents a wolf. 
The figure must originally have held or been designed to hold 
something in his right hand.

124 and 125. Pair of andiron 
ornaments in the form of nude putti 
riding rampant lions and holding 
shields
18.3 cms. (height of group with the shield held in the putto's 
right hand, from the lion's left foot); 17.7 cms. (height of group 
with the shield held in the putto's left hand, from the lion's left 
foot); 12.7 cms. (diameter of wooden socles)
Bronze with a black varnish. Hollow, probably lostwax, cast. The 
surfaces have all been roughly chiselled. There are flaws in the grou 
p 
with the shield held in the putto's right hand and chaplet holes in 
both groups. The groups are fixed to turned wooden socles coloured 
to resemble bronze. On the undersides of the socles are fringed 
circular paper labels inscribed `J. J. de Zoete' in ink.
Bought with the George Flood France Bequest Fund in 1935 from 
the dealers Cecil Leitch and Kerin. Entered in the Donations Book 
on 30 April together with Nos. 119 and 120.
As was noted in the Annual Report for 1935 (p. 25) the 
groups must have come from a pair of andirons_the heraldic 
character of the design and the arms held by the putti support 
this. The bases to which they are now attached must be 
replacements. There is another pair of very similar character 
but with clubs held in place of shields in the Kunsthistorisches 
Museum in Vienna (reproduced L. Planiscig, Venezianische 
Bildhauer der Renaissance (Berlin, Vienna, 1921), 607). These 
groups were attributed to Nicolo~6 Roccatagliata but this would 
have been on account of the anatomy and, still more, the 
faces of the putti which, however, are found generally in 
Venetian sculpture of the second half of the sixteenth century 
as is discussed in the entry for No. 82. The quality of the 
sculpture that can be documented as by Roccatagliata is 
superior in design and execution to these. It is unlikely that 
any of the three principal components in each group was 
originally designed for each other. The putti hold the shields 
as if they were supported below, which they are not. The two 
lions are essentially the same and the wax models were 
probably taken from the same mould and the heads then 
twisted into different directions. The two putti on the other 
hand are reversed in pose, but in neither case do they sit 
agreeably on their mount_the right leg of the putto with the 
shield in his left hand is in particularly unhappy relationship 
with the raised back right leg of the lion. The putti appear to 
grip the lions by their names but a piece of inconsequential 
drapery emerges above their hands. The groups are perhaps 
more likely to be the work of a thirdrate Venetian founder 
improvising with spare moulds than pastiches devised by a 
forger.

126. Dead Christ
25.7 cms. (height); 50.8 cms. (length of figure); 55 cms. (length 
of plinth); 19.5 cms. (width of plinth); 6.5 cms. (height of plinth)
Painted terracotta. The paint has darkened but the drapery is still 
red and some red may be discerned in the wounds. The flesh is 
now a dark olive brown but may be distinguished from the darker 
brown of the ground. The rear of the model is unpainted and is a 
pale beige colour. The paint has flaked in numerous small areas. The 

figure has been broken along the lower edge and part of the drapery 
and all the fingers of Christ's right hand are missing. The terracott 
a 
has been bolted to a plinth of rosewood with four separately carved 
feet. The bolts have not been unfastened but if the clay has been 
hollowed it must, to judge by the weight, be very thick walled.
Bequeathed by F. HindleySmith in 1939 (Annual Report (1940), 
16). The sculpture seems always to have been displayed on a cassone 
in the Fortnum Gallery.
The sculpture, which was highly untypical of the collection 
from which it came (a collection consisting largely of 
Impressionist and PostImpressionist works, for which see 
Preliminary Essay in Vol. II), was described on acquisition as 
`School of Jacopo Sansovino'. It is indebted, in the build of 
the body, the facial type, and, above all, the half open hand, 
to the Christ in Michelangelo's Pieta~6 (for which see No. 60). 
It may well be by a Florentine sculptor such as Sansovino 
who had studied Michelangelo deeply, but it is hard to date. 
The plinth with its simple spreading hollow sides and lack of 
mouldings must be early twentieth century and looks like 
French work. It is unusually well chosen for colour, polish, 
and proportions.
A sample was drilled from the rear of the terracotta in April 
1987 by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Research Laboratory 
for Art and Archaeology but it proved to have been taken 
from a restoration and no dating by thermoluminescence 
was possible (ref. 381z89).

127 and 128. Pair of nude boy 
supporters from a cabinet
19.5 cms. (height of boy with right arm raised); 19.6 cms. (height 
of boy with left arm raised); 4.8 cms. (length of block supported 
by boy with right arm raised); 4.6 cms. (width of block supported 
by boy with right arm raised); 4.7 cms. (length and width of 
block upon which boy with right arm raised is standing); 4.6 cms. 
(length and width of block supported by boy with left arm 
raised); 4.8 cms. (length and width of block upon which boy with 
left arm raised in standing)
Ebony. Each figure including plinth, and block supported, is carved 
out of a single piece. In the case of the boy with right arm raised 
there is a small loss in the corner at the back of the plinth to prop 
er 
right. In the other case a large piece of wood is missing at the same 

point. In both cases there are two holes in the upper surface of the 

supported block and three on the underside of the plinth including 
one which perforates the entire plinth between the feet of the boy. 
`Stanmore' is written in pencil on the underside of the plinth 
supporting the boy with right arm raised. The hand resembles that 
of C. F. Bell.
Presumably in the bequest of C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. The items 
are not included in his large or notebook catalogues and bear no 
mark but one has the name of Fortnum's house written on it and 
they correspond with an entry in his preliminary catalogue of 1857: 
`Two boys in Ebony: part of a Cabinet? The hand raised to support 
the frieze or moulding above the head. Venetian work. Cinque 
cento. 812^_ with the provenance ``Venice 1851'' ' (p. 70, nos. 1 an 
d 
2 of the section `Carvings in Wood etc.').
It is curious that Fortnum, whose cataloguing was so 
scrupulous, should have omitted these items. The explanation 
may lie in his uncertainty whether to class them as 
miscellaneous sculpture or with furniture. They may well be 
Venetian of the sixteenth century as he supposed, or perhaps 
a little later in date: the character of the curled heads is 
certainly reminiscent of Venetian bronzes of that period (such 
as Nos. 124 and 125).

129. Pieta~6
39.5 cms. (height including integral plinth); 16.7 cms. (length of 
plinth); 14.4 cms. (width of plinth)
Terracotta of a pale pinky beige colour. Solid, but what might have 
been an aperture in the underside of the base is filled with plaster. 

The Virgin's left forearm has been broken off and lost, as have both 

legs of Christ just above the ankles, parts of Christ's left hand, pa 
rt 
of His nose, and a portion of the Virgin's drapery behind Christ's 
left shoulder. Christ's right arm has been broken a little above the 

elbow and repaired. The Virgin's left arm has been broken and 
repaired, crudely with glue, at the elbow. There are breaks across 
the Virgin's back, through a large portion of the Virgin's drapery 
near the plinth, and through the plinth which have been cemented 
very obviously. There are numerous minor chips. The modelling has 
been blunted by the addition of a thick slip. In some areas the 
granular and bubbly character of this mixture can be clearly perceive 
d. 
In others it appears to have been partially scraped off. The abraded 

face of Christ is given a certain coherence by this slip; but it make 
s 
the fingers of the Virgin's right hand almost indistinguishable from 

the cloth beneath.
Bought in 1961 from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf) of The 
Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, Lonon W1, for Â£315 (the price 
being reduced from Â£350 by 10 per cent). The invoice, dated 19 

September, was passed for payment on the following day. The 
sculpture was registered on 15 October. Photographs taken in 1974 
show it in a glass case in the FoxStrangways Room. It has been in 
basement storage for at least a decade.
The sculpture was recorded by Ian Robertson in the Annual 
Report for 1961 (p. 64) as of the `Venetian school . . . from 
the middle of the 16th century, emanating certainly from the 
circle of Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570) with a strong imprint 
of the influence of Michelangelo. Instinct with an intensity of 
emotion, it displays a simple dignity and pathos unexpected in 
a work of so small a scale. Doubtless conceived to be carried 
out in lifesize figures, it has not yet been possible to connect 
it with any known group of the subject.' It is certainly indebted 
to Michelangelo's Pieta~6. It does look like a sketch model, 
and an Italian work of the sixteenth or seventeenth century. 
It might be Venetian.
Notes in the Department's files and on an old label indicate 
that Robertson did later connect it with a large group: that in 
the lunette of the huge wall monument to Doge Francesco 
Venier (d. 1556) in S. Salvatore in Venice, completed in 
1561, to designs by Sansovino. This particular part of the 
tomb was delegated by Sansovino to Alessandro Vittoria in 
1557-8. The similarities are very slight and superficial. 
Vittoria's group has a bolder outline: the Virgin's left arm 
stretches out with a clear gesture and her knees form a solid 
base for the body of her Son, whereas the support in the 
terracotta is notably weak. The terracotta is also surely not a 
model for a relief.

130. Lamentation
33.9 cms. (height including integral base); 27 cms. (length of 
integral base); 1 cm. (height of integral base in front)
Wood (lime ?) covered with gesso and paint. The paint has 
discoloured and flaked, as has the gesso in some parts. Some of the 
paint would seem not to be original, for instance the red on parts 
of the robe of Mary Magdalene is evidently applied on top of a 
blue. There are traces of gilding on the rim of the base, the hat of 

Joseph of Arimathea, and the implements he holds. The group 
appears to have been carved from a single piece of wood (although 
joins could easily be disguised by the gesso). There is severe damage 

from woodworm. The Virgin's raised left hand has been broken off 
and lost: the stump is riddled with worm channels. The top of the 
ladder has also been broken off and lost. One of the uprights was 
also clearly weakened in this manner. The group is carefully coloured 

behind but the composition is flattened as if to be set against a 
background. A slot in the back of the base at the centre may have 
been for a cross against which the group is likely to have been set.
Bought from Mary Bellis, Charnham Close, Hungerford, in 1964. 
Registered on 20 January 1964. Mary Bellis was chiefly a dealer in 
old oak furniture, but see Nos. 12 and 416.
Ian Robertson described this acquisition in the Annual Report 

for 1964 (p. 50) as `North Italian in origin and somewhat 
provincial in character, it is nevertheless a dramatic and moving 
group, the form of which owes much to Michelangelo's 
rendering of the subject, in particular in the central figure of 
the Virgin supporting the body of Christ in her lap'. He 
dated it to the middle of the sixteenth century. It may well 
be later for thirdrate devotional carvings are notoriously 
conservative in character.

131. Bust portrait in profile of a 
bearded ecclesiastic
32.6 cms. (height); 26 cms. (width)
Carrara marble, discoloured grey. The relief ground has been cut 
out so that there is no ground behind the crown of the head. Plaster 

adheres to parts of the back of the relief and a wedge of concrete 
has been attached to the lower portions of it so that it can stand 
up. There was originally an aperture in the underside of the bust 
presumably for fixing it.
Provenance unrecorded. Transferred from the basements of the 
Department of Antiquities in 1986.
The studied curls of the hair and beard and the smoothly 
rounded, clean outlined, inflated body suggest Baccio 
Bandinelli's relief style at its least animated taken to the point 
of parody. It is hard to imagine the setting from which this 
has been extracted, and it is not easy to imagine the setting 
for which it has been adapted.

132. Youth attired as a Roman 
warrior
29.8 cms. (height, including integral plinth); 1.3 cms. (height of 
integral plinth at rear); 1.2 cms. (height of integral plinth at 
front); 6.9 cms. (length of plinth); 5.9 cms. (width of plinth)
Ivory. There is a yellow patch on the proper right knee, much yellow 

on the rear of the figure, and a grey patch, perhaps a stain, on the 

figure's chest. These are numerous thin vertical splits of various 
length (most densely on the face and the cloak as it passes over the 

upper chest), numerous cracks (in the figure's left hand and arm, 
and above his left knee especially), numerous breaks mended with 
more or less conspicuous adhesive (in the figure's right arm at the 
elbow and wrist, in the figure's right hand across fingers and baton, 

and across both shins), some insertions of ivory (in the neck to 
proper right and in the figure's left thigh and also of mastic filler 
in 
this thigh), numerous losses (the finger of the figure's left hand, a 

portion of the edge of the cloak above his right elbow, and much 
of the edge of the cloak behind), and numerous chips and scratches. 
Splits, cracks, joins, and scratches are accentuated by dirt. Most of 


the figure's right arm and the whole of his left arm have been 
separately carved and attached. The join in the latter case coincides 

with the edge of the breastplate. In the former the join is concealed 

by the cloak and reinforced with a peg visible in the cloak. The plin 
th 
is also carved from a different piece of ivory and pegs attaching the 

feet to it are visible on its underside. `M.215' is painted in black 
to 
the left of the back face of the plinth. Vestiges of old labels, both 

printed and manuscript, remain on the underside of the plinth.
Bequeathed by J. Francis Mallett who died 7 January 1947. Received 
in the Museum during the last week of May 1947. No. 215 in the 
inventory of Mallett's bequest. Catalogued by Mallett as `ex Magniac 

and Kennedy Collections. Christie 1933 Girdwood Collection'. 
Valued by Mallett at Â£58. Bought at Christie's, London, in 1933, 
according to Mallett. The vendor was a certain Girdwood. It was 
lot 387 in the sale at Christie's 18-22 March 1918 of the collection 

of S. E. Kennedy where it was bought by `Webster' from Â£65 2s. 
The catalogue claimed that it came from the `Magniac Collection', 
i.e. the great collection of Objets d'art sold in 1892 and in large 
part collected by 1861 when the best pieces were published in J. C. 
Robinson's Notice of the Principal Works of Art in the Collection of 

Hollingworth Magniac. But I have not traced it in the sale catalogues 
.
Mallett regarded this ivory as `sixteenth or early seventeenth 
century' and noted that it was `reputed to be Cosimo 1st 
Grand Duke of Tuscany'. A thin and crumpled piece of paper 
in the Department's files with a typewritten account of the 
sculpture may have come from Mallett's papers and been 
acquired by him together with the ivory itelf. Having quoted 
the Kennedy sale catalogue in which the statuette was 
catalogued as `Italian sixteenth century', representing `in all 
probability Cosimo I de Medici in Roman armour; about his 
lorica is the collar of the Golden Fleece', it continues to assert 
that `the opinion of several wellknown judges adds 
confirmation to the above probability. This is still further 
strength [sic] by reference to ``Les Medailleurs de la 
Renaissance_Florence_deuxie~6me partie'' by Alois Heiss, in 
which there are two reproductions of portraits of Cosimo I. 
Each shows the curly hair and the determined mouth while 
the features bear a striking resemblance to those of the 
statuette.' It does not seem impossible that this is an idealized 
portrait of Cosimo (1519-74, created duke in 1537 and grand 
duke in 1567) at about the age of 25 (in 1546) when he was 
made a Knight of the Golden Fleece by the Emperor 
Charles V. However, comparison with the portrait busts by 
Cellini and Bandinelli of 1545 and with the painting by 

Bronzino does not support this hypothesis since in both 
portraits he sports a slight beard. Some connection with the 
Medici is on the other hand suggested by comparison with 
the late sixteenthcentury marble statues in the Sala del 
Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence_Vincenzo de' 
Rossi's Alessandro de' Medici for instance has very similar 
stylized curls and Caccini's Grand Duke Francesco I wears 
very similar armour.
An ivory figure of a crowned warrior with a thick beard, 
holding a sword in his right hand and pointing downwards 
with his left, wearing a more ornate cuirass but very similar 
buskins (lot 1,874 at the sale of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, 
by Sotheby's, 23 May 1977), was also said to represent 
Cosimo (for no good reason). It looks, from photographs, 
as if it might be a work by the same artist. The similar size 
(30 cms.) and antique dress might even suggest that both 
belonged to a series, were it not for different bases (the 
Mentmore warrior treads on slugs and snails and snakes).

133. Five profile portrait busts in a carved frame
6.3 cms. (height of the male bust portrait placed top left_(a ); 
5.7 cms. (height of the female bust portrait placed top right_
(b ); 5.8 cms. (height of the male bust portrait placed lower left_
(c ); 5.6 cms. (height of the male bust portrait placed lower 
right_(d ); 6.2 cms. (height of the central male bust portrait_
(e ); 28 cms. (outside height of frame); 29.5 cms. (outside width 
of frame)
Wax of various colours mounted on slate within a boxwood frame. 
Minute pearls, paste jewels, and a silver chain are applied to the 
wax. The representation of clothing has been aided by impressing 
fine fabric on to the wax to obtain convincing textures. There is 
some damage to the edges of the profile of the face of (c). There is 

a crack across the lower part of the face of (d ). There is a crack 
across the neck of (b ) where a discoloured adhesive is also apparent 
.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed by him 
in 1899. S. 30 in his catalogues. Stated in both catalogues to have 
been bought in Florence in 1864; the price of Â£5 is given only in 
the notebook catalogue.
Fortnum recorded that the waxes `are stated to be portraits 
of members & connections of the Medici family'_
presumably stated by the dealer from whom he bought them. 
The frame, which looks like midnineteenthcentury work, 
has Medici lilies in the cartouches at the corners perhaps to 
reinforce this association. He regarded the portraits as 
Florentine of the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. 
In his notebook catalogue he wrote `They are probably the 
work of the AbbÃ© Lumbo or Zumbo (a Sicilian) who worked 
for Cosimo III in the second half of the seventeenth century' 
but then corrected `are probably the work of' to `have been 
attributed to' adding the parenthetical observation `these look 
earlier'. The dress does indeed suggest a date in the late 

sixteenth century. The man (a) wears the red cross of Malta. 
The younger man (c) wears the order of the Golden Fleece 
over black armour. The man (e) wears a cross `fleury gules' 
on a collar set with rubies and emeralds. As Fortnum justly 
observes there is a `certain family likeness' between all the 
portraits excepting (e). The latter is not only of a different 
size in the face but has paler flesh tones. Fortnum wondered 
whether (a) and (b ) were brother and sister and (d) the father 
of (c). Alternatively (a) and (b ) may be the parents of (c) and 
(d ). Little is known of the artists responsible for work of this 
kind.
C. F. Bell in a pencil annotation of Fortnum's large 
catalogue observed of (e) that `a replica' of it which `was said 
to be in coloured stone (pietra commessa) and not wax and 
to represent a Spaniard_connected doubtless in some way 
with the Grand Ducal court_is in the Gabinetto delle Gemme 
in the Uffizi'.
The portraits are similar in minute workmanship to those 
of King Philip II of Spain and members of his family which 
survive in their original lockets in the Victoria and Albert 
Museum (A. 523, A. 524, A. 525, A. 5261910) and have 
been attributed to Antonio Abondio (c. 1538-91). The 
evidence for this attribution is set out in J. PopeHennessy, 
Catalogue of Italian Sculpture in the Victoria and Albert 
Museum, 3 vols. (London, 1964), ii. 556, nos. 594-8. It is 
admitted there that they differ in style from those wax portraits 
of the Emperor Maximilian II and his wife in the Mu~8nzkabinett 
at Munich (for which see Habich, `Studien zu Antonio und 
Alessandro Abondio', Monatsberichte u~8ber Kunstwissenschaft 
und Kunsthandel, 1 (1900-1), 400-7, and Fiala, Antonio 
Abondio, keroplastik a medajlÃ©r (Prague, 1909), 46, nos. 82-
3) but it is claimed that there is a close relationship with the 
wax profiles of an unknown lady and of Mary, wife of the 
Emperor Maximilian II, in the Ambrosiana, Milan, attributed 
to Abondio. But it is not at all clear that these two portraits 
in Milan are by the same hand, and the second of the two, 
which looks more likely to be by Abondio, has a fluttering 
diaphanous scarf which introduces a poetic element and linear 
interest unparalleled in the literal portraits in the Victoria and 
Albert Museum. (The two Milan waxes, together with one of 
the Emperor Maximilian II, are published by E. Kris, `Di 
alcune opere inedite dell'Ambrosiana', Dedalo, 9 (1928-9), 
390-6.) Comparison should also be made with the wax 
portraits of this period in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin
Dahlem, for instance 5466, of Joanna of Austria, attributed 
to Domenico Poggini, and 8275, considered to be Italian and 
c. 1600 (no. 52, pl. 49, in U. Schlegel, Die italienischn 
Bildwerke des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts (Staatliche Museen, 
BerlinDahlem, 1978) ).


134. Bust portrait of Christ
24 cms. (height including socle); 13.8 cms. (height of marble 
base); 12.8 cms. (diameter of base)

Bronze with a slightly leaden brown patina with slight traces of a 
darker varnish. Hollow, lostwax, cast in two pieces: the bust 
separate from the socle. The surface has been minutely tooled (see 
below).
Bought out of the Blakiston Fund from Peel and Humphris Ltd. of 
37 New Bond Street, London W1 for Â£195_the invoice is dated 
1 December 1961, payment was authorized on 14 December, the 
bust was registered on 27 December.
On the invoice, made out by the dealer Cyril Humphris, this 
bust was attributed to Bastiano Torrigiani. Ian Robertson, 
describing the acquisition in the Annual Report for 1961 
(pp. 62-3), wrote that
the clue to the probable authorship of this bust is supplied by the 
small portrait of Pope Clement XIII, recently exhibited at the 
Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the papal effigy being 
supported by an identical socle, in the form of the deferentially 
bowed head of a cherub, alike in design and execution to that 
supporting the present bust (PopeHennessy, Arts Council 
Exhibition of Italian Bronze Statuettes, 1961, Victoria and Albert 
Museum, No. 185). . . . The attribution of the papal bust to 
Torrigiani is due, on the evidence of two large papal busts by this 
artist in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, in Berlin, to Bode (Bildwerke 

des Kaiser Friedrich Museums, Die italienische Bildwerke der
, 1930, ii, p. 2, nos. 6 and 7, plates 5
and 6)

It is indeed true that the socle of the papal bust (in fact of 
Pope Gregory XIV and in the Rijksmuseum and not certainly 
by Torrigiani) is similar in design to that supporting the 
Ashmolean's bust of Christ, but that bust could hardly be 
more different in execution, being remarkably freely modelled 
in the wax and virtually unworked after casting, whereas every 
aspect of the Ashmolean's bronze is precisely tooled.
The socle may indeed be a clue as to the origin of the bust 
of Christ. A combination of scrolls, wings, and head are 
found also in some other sixteenthcentury supports for busts, 
for instance that devised by Pompeo Leoni for his bust of 
King Philip II of Spain in the Prado. But the complex character 
of the scroll support behind the cherub in the Ashmolean's 
bust which is not found in the Leoni, nor in the Rijksmuseum 
bust, is unmistakably characteristic of Florence in the second 
half of the sixteenth or in the early decades of the seventeenth 
century_such an object might be found, little modified, in 
a female coiffure invented by Bronzino, or as a console 
designed by Buontalenti. The bronze holy water basins 
supported by cherubs and scrolls in the cortile of SS Annuziata 
in Florence which are dated 1615 are similar in conception. 
It may be questioned whether this socle was originally 
designed for the bust, or merely adapted to it, but in any 
case the impassive expression and high finish of the bust do 
correspond with the ideals of Florentine devotional art in the 
second half of the sixteenth century as they are familiar in 
painting. Of the busts of Christ in Berlin (neither of which is 

large as Robertson claimed) one is from the same model as 
the Ashmolean's but has a cartouche, also of very Florentine 
character in place of the cherub.
Apart from Torrigiani, the only other sculptor that seems 
to have been seriously considered as the author of this bust 
is Antonio Abondio (1538-91), on the grounds of a similarity 
with his medallions of Christ (see U. Schlegel, `Einige 
italienische Kleinbronzen der Renaissance', Pantheon (1966), 
2: 391-6 and, for these and other medals of Christ, G. F. 
Hill, The Medallic Portraits of Christ (Oxford, 1920) ). But 
RudolfAlexander Schu~8lle is right to reject this connection as 
in any way conclusive (see his entry for the version of this 
bust in Berlin) in the catalogue of the exhibition Prag um 
1600 held in Prague in 1988 (593, no. 491).
Three other versions of the Ashmolean's bust are recorded: 
that in Berlin, already mentioned (Staatliche Museen, Berlin
Dahlem, 10/62); one formerly in the collection of Oscar 
Bondy in Vienna which was lot 76, Sotheby's, New York, 25 
November 1986, and one in the Metropolitan Museum, New 
York (40.14.2a, in store). In all four versions there are minor 
differences in finish: the base mouldings of the socles are 
varied as is the chiselling of the beard and texturing of the 
garments. The finish on the Ashmolean's bust is most unusual: 
the tunic and cloak (punched in most of the other versions) 
are completely covered in finely crosshatched engraved lines. 
These are also used for Christ's flesh, only on a more minute 
scale. In character these lines exactly resemble those used in 
highly finished copperplate prints from around 1600. I have 
never seen this finish on any other bronze of the sixteenth or 
seventeenth century although it is a distinctive characteristic 
of the bronzes produced by the firm of Elkington in 
Birmingham in the midnineteenth century (for instance the 
statuettes of Burke and Goldsmith after Foley) and is found, 
also on the bronze chiselled by A. Mertens after Christian 
Daniel Rauch's group of Emerentia Lorenz von Taugermunde 
in the SchinkelPavillion, Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin. 
Elkington probably transferred the technique from silver and 
this may also have been the case with the bust of Christ 
centuries earlier.
There is another type of bust of Christ with which the 
versions under discussion have often been associated. These 
are similar in size but have more expression; they do not have 
the cherub support; Christ is turned to his right; the folds of 
his tunic are quite different; his beard is not parted; his hair 
is longer and less regular, some of the locks falling over his 
right shoulder being pierced; and there is a knob to attach a 
halo. One example of this type was lot 65 at Sotheby's, 
London, 20 April 1989, previously exhibited in Sculpture 
from the David Daniels Collection (Minneapolis Institute of 
Arts, 1979-80), 56-7, no. 18; others are in the Victoria and 
Albert Museum (A. 811951, gilt); the Staatliche Museen, 
BerlinDahlem (inv. no. 5033); and the collection of Sir 
Brinsley Ford, London (bought Christie's, London, 2 June 
1964, lot 49). Of these the Daniels and Victoria and Albert 

versions seem to be aftercasts (as pointed out in the Daniels 
catalogue). That in Berlin is quite distinctive in modelling, 
being far less tooled: it also has a more slender socle of an 
unorthodox shape. There need be no connection between 
these busts and those of the type represented at Oxford 
beyond the fact that some of them reflect a similar taste for 
very precise and minute goldsmiths' finish. Schlegel (op. cit.) 
associates both of them with a popular pair of miniature busts 
of Christ and the Virgin Mary as well as with the medals of 
Christ by Abondio.

135. Belvedere Torso
22 cms. (height)
Terracotta of a pale orange beige colour. The model has been broken 
and reassembled. There are vertical joins to proper right of the 
abdomen and to proper left of the chest and there is a horizontal 
join to proper right of the upper abdomen. On the back the 
horizontal join continues to the proper left side where it meets a 
vertical break which passes through the whole figure. There are 
other lines which are cracks rather than breaks. Some of the chips 
missing along the lines of the breaks have been filled with orange 
wax. A chip has been lost from the shoulder to proper left. The 
torso has been broken away from what was perhaps a separately 
modelled base. A cavity between the legs has been filled with wax 
and mastic to fasten a large nail into place. The projecting point of 

this is used to secure the terracotta to a stepped plinth made of 
wood covered in green velvet.
Bought from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf), The Royal Arcade, 
28 Old Bond Street, London W1, in January 1961 for Â£500. 
Registered on 31 January. Photographs in the Department's files of 
the sculpture which must have been supplied by the dealer were 
made by a Roman photographer (Boccardi of Via delle Carrozze), 
which indicates an Italian provenance.
The marble fragment of a heroic seated male figure, signed 
by Athenian sculptor, Apollonius, known in Rome (where it 
was probably excavated) in the fifteenth century, became one 
of the most famous sculptures in the world with its installation 
in the Belvedere Courtyard of the Vatican after which it was 
named. It has remained ever since one of the chief attractions 
of the Papal Museums. A full account of its history and 
reputation is given in F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and 
the Antique (London and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 311-
14. This reduced copy in terracotta omits the disfiguring 
cavities and chips in the proper right thigh and chest and also 
the portion of a block, draped with the lion skin of Hercules 
and chiselled with the name of Apollonius, upon which the 
hero sits, although it is likely that this was originally included. 
At the neck, upper chest, shoulders, thighs, and penis the 
modeller has freely combed the clay instead of attempting to 
reproduce the rough surface of the fractured marble. The 
copy is of a quality which suggests that it must have been 
made from the original or from a cast, rather than from prints 
or drawings. That copies of this size existed by the 1530s is 

clear from the fact that one is included in a family portrait by 
Bernardino Licinio (Villa Borghese, Rome). Nevertheless 
such copies continued to be valued and must have multiplied 
in subsequent centuries and we cannot agree with Parker that 
`it is probable' that this copy `was executed soon after the 
setting up of the marble in the Belvedere Gardens, that is to 
say in the second quarter of the 16th century, by an artist of 
the Roman School of Michelangelo (1475-1564)'.
Samples of the Torso have been taken by Mrs Doreen 
Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology 
and the History of Art on two occasions, in 1973 and in 
March 1987. Thermoluminiscence tests suggested a firing 
date between 1428 and 1698 on the first occasion (ref. 81
m64) and between 1467 and 1647 on the second (ref. 381
z87).


136. Aesculapius
13 cms. (height including integral plinth); 3 cms. (height of base); 

5.1 cms. (length of base); 3.9 cms. (width of base)
Bronze, firegilt, with some patches tarnished black, also worn in a 

few areas to reveal a natural coppery chocolate patina. Hollow, lost 

wax, cast. There are firing cracks in the god's right arm and in one 

of the coils of the snake. `B. 425. ' is painted in black on the 
black face of the plinth. Mounted on a block of antique serpentine.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 19 August 1887 and given by him in 
1888. B. 425 in his notebook catalogue. Bought in Florence in 
1867 for `20 francs' according to that catalogue. The bronze altar 
pedestal upon which it was placed when in Fortnum's collection_
B. 425A in his notebook catalogue, B. 712 in his large catalogue_
was removed before it was lent in 1887.
Fortnum regarded this bronze as Italian of the sixteenth 
century and `an imitation of the antique', `derived if not 
copied from an antique statue'. It is surely possible that it is 
later in date and in any case the rather poor (perhaps aftercast) 
Paduan pedestal in the form of an altar and probably dating 
from the early sixteenth century (similar to that supporting a 
little Apollo, B. 414 in Fortnum's collection) now looks quite 
inappropriate. This pedestal was cleaned of its green paint by 
Bell in 1902 and probably had its rosso antico slabs on top 
and below removed later in this century when a small bronze 
Silenus, perhaps from the Bodleian Library, was fixed to it 
instead. I have found no exact ancient prototype for the 
figure.


137. Pair of winged putti bridling a 
lion
23.1 cms. (height) 30 cms. (length)
Carrara marble, discoloured grey. There are a couple of fresh 

scratches on the cheeks of the prominent putto. There are a few 
old chips missing from the uppermost edge of the relief slab. The 
shape of the slab is unlikely to be original: the angles at which the 

corners are cut off are not equal. A less discoloured rectangular pat 
ch 
in front of the chest of the lion indicates the position of a relativ 
ely 
recent paper label.
Provenance unrecorded. Transferred from the basements of the 
Department of Antiquities in 1986.
The sculpture looks like one of a series of playful variations 
on a family emblem such as might adorn the frieze of an 
Italian villa or palace, possibly of the sixteenth, but more 
probably of the seventeenth, century.

138. Head of the PseudoSeneca
40.5 cms. (height); 3 cms. (height of base at the front)
Grey, slightly peppery, marble. The surface is severely weathered 
and battered. Large chips are missing from the hair on the front of 
the crown, the end of the nose, and the back of the neck. The top 
of the chest is cut in a manner which suggests that insertion into a 

separate marble bust of drapery was intended. Drill holes are apparen 
t 
in the corners of the eyes and in the hair beside the ears. The head 

has been mounted on a small shaped beech base.
Provenance unrecorded. Perhaps given to Oxford University by the 
dowager countess of Pomfret (see No. 517) in 1755. If so, then 
the head is probably from the collection assembled by Thomas 
Howard, earl of Arundel, in the early seventeenth century which 
was bought by the countess's fatherinlaw Sir William Fermor (later 

Lord Lempster) from the 6th duke of Norfolk in 1691 and kept at 
Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. In Oxford the Pomfret 
Collection was displayed in the sculpture gallery of the Old Schools 

until its transfer to the University Galleries, but there is no certa 
in 
reference to this head in any of the nineteenthcentury Handbook 
Guides, although it could be one of several items simply identified 
as `a head' which were to be seen in the Crypt or SubGallery. It 
was not noticed by Michaelis on his, admittedly hurried, visit in the 

late 1870s to compile his Ancient Marbles in Great Britain 
(Cambridge, 1882). It was discovered in store and placed on display 
in the Randolph Gallery by Michael Vickers in the mid1970s.
The head is a copy of a famous antique portrait type which, 
it was proposed by Fulvio Orsini in a publication of 1598, 
represented the stoic philosopher Seneca. (For an account of 
the type see F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique 
(London and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 52.) It has been 
remarked by Michael Vickers that the version of the portrait 

of Seneca which presides over Rubens's famous group portrait 
(now in the Uffizi, Florence) of four philosophers is more 
similar to this than to any other surviving replica (although 
there are differences; most obviously the upper chest is cut 
off more squarely in the Ashmolean version). He has pointed 
out that Rubens's own version of this portrait may well have 
been acquired by the duke of Buckingham together with 
much of his collection and if so might have been acquired 
from Buckingham by Arundel (as is known to have happened 
in other cases).



139 and 140. Pair of supports 
involving heraldic animal heads
59 cms. (height of Nos. 139 and 140); 103 cms. (length of 139); 
25 cms. (width of 139); 102.8 cms. (length of 140); 26.5 cms. 
(width of 140).
White marble with a coarse crystalline structure (probably Greek, 
perhaps excavated in Rome), severely weathered and with black 
stains below the mouths of the talbots and lions. Both pieces are 
rough hewn on the reverse. The undercut branch in the mouth of 
the horse has cracked to proper left and has broken off to proper 
right in 139 but survives in 140. There is a large chip from the lowe 
r 
corner to proper right of 140 and cracks across the brow of the 
talbot and the horse.
Given to Oxford University by the dowager countess of Pomfret 
(see No. 517) in 1755. They must have been made for Thomas 
Howard, 2nd earl of Arundel, since they are decorated with the 
heraldic animals proper to him_the horse, lion, and talbot (a breed 
of hound). They were acquired with a large portion of the Arundel 
marbles by the countess's fatherinlaw Sir William Fermor (later 
Lord Lempster) from the 6th duke of Norfolk in 1691 and were for 
a long time in the gardens at his seat of Easton Neston, 
Northamptonshire. By 1732 the marbles there had `lately almost all' 
been taken within doors_but these items might well have been 
among the exceptions (`The Vertue Notebooks', Walpole Society, 
24 (1935-6), 40). In Oxford the supports were kept in the Schools 
until their transfer to the University Galleries where they are recor 
ded 
in the Handbook Guide of 1859 in the Crypt or SubGallery, but 
visible to the public (19, nos. 68 and 69). For much of this century 

they were in store, but they were placed in the Randolph Gallery 
in the 1970s.
A list of works of art exported from Rome for Lord Arundel 
in 1626 includes (in addition to many paintings; `una testa 
di metallo di Socrate di naturale moderna'; four cases of `gessi 
moderni' of legs, torsoes, heads, busts; a draped portrait 
statue of Lord Arundel 9 palmi high; and many antique 
figures extensively restored) the following items: `2 piedi 
intagliati di commesso con l'arme del Sig Conte della Rondella 
con la sua tavola di 10 palmi lunga et 5 larga di commesso 

di varie sorte di alabastri et di mischio moderni'_that is two 
carved supports (`piedi') inlaid with the arms of the earl of 
Arundel with their table top, 10 palmi long and 5 wide, inlaid 
with varied alabasters and modern figured marbles of a smoky 
pattern (F. Gori, Archivio storico artistico archeologico 
letterario romano (1880), fasc. 11, pp. 74-91). The 
identification of Rondella as Arundel, and the significance of 
this reference, were first pointed out by Jacob Hess (`Lord 
Arundel in Rom und sein Auftrag an den Bildhauer Egidio 
Moretti', English Miscellany, 1 (1950), 213). These supports 
are carved with Arundel heraldry and would carry a slab of 
the size mentioned although one would certainly expect to 
find a plinth beneath them. Nevertheless the document does 
specify that the supports included marble inlay which these 
do not. A recent book on Arundel interprets `Sua tavola', 
which must in context mean `their table top', as `his picture' 
and `commesso' as `mosaic', and supposes that Arundel
had commissioned a mosaic portrait of himself 9 feet high
(D. Howarth, Lord Arundel and his Circle (New Haven, 
Conn., and London, 1985), 56-7).
The nature of the marble used for these supports suggests 
that they were made in Rome, carved out of `marmo di 
scavo'. The carving is coarse with a very obvious use of a large 
drill. The back of each support is so rough that one wonders 
whether they were intended to be incorporated in a wall. The 
Handbook Guide to the University Galleries described them 
as the fronts of capitals for pilasters and as ancient work. 
Michaelis, surprisingly, did not question this (Ancient 
Marbles in Great Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 571, nos. 123 
and 124).


141. Head of a Niobid
40.5 cms. (height); 16 cms. (height of plinth)
White marble, probably Carrara. The surface is slightly worn. There 
is a vertical crack in the chest to proper left. A chip is also missi 
ng 
from the boy's left ear and from the nose. The head is mounted on 
a plain stone plinth with no mouldings but a bold chamfer. This 
has been painted black. The marble was cleaned by Kathleen Kimber 
using the steam process in 1989.
Given to Oxford University by the dowager countess of Pomfret 
(see No. 517) in 1755. The head is probably from the collection 
assembled by Thomas Howard, 2nd earl of Arundel, in the early 
seventeenth century which was bought by the countess's fatherin
law Sir William Fermor (later Lord Lempster) from the 6th duke of 
Norfolk in 1691 and kept at Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. In 
Oxford the Pomfret collection was displayed in the sculpture gallery 

of the Old Schools until its transfer to the University Galleries whe 
re 
this head was recorded in the Handbook Guide of 1889 in the Crypt 
or SubGallery but visible to the public (19, no. 54). Early in this 


century (perhaps late in the last) it was consigned to store. It was 

placed again on display, this time in the Randolph Gallery, by 
Michael Vickers in 1980 (Annual Report (1979-80), 12).
The head was engraved in Richard Chandler's Marmora 
Oxoniensia in 1763 (no. 55) with no indication that it was 
not a genuine antique, but Michaelis (Ancient Marbles in 
Great Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 557, no. 63) observed that 
`to me the head appears modern' and the view that it is a copy 
has prevailed ever since. The figure from whose head it is 
copied is the son of Niobe with his left knee raised in the 
group of Niobe and her children, now in the Uffizi but in 
Arundel's day (and indeed still in Lord Pomfret's) in the Villa 
Medici in Rome. The group was discovered early in 1583, 
restored by 1588, and erected in the garden of the Villa
(F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London
and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 274-8). How Arundel came
to acquire such a work (if indeed he did do so) is unknown: 
modern marble copies were not, it seems, characteristic of his 
collection. The fact that he owned a version of the head of 
Niobe herself (considered by some to be the finest version 
extant, but thought by Michaelis to be perhaps modern_
op. cit. 557, no. 62) may well be pertinent. He may not of 
course have acquired the head as a modern copy (there is, 
after all, no evidence of anyone suspecting its status before 
Michaelis). If he did acquire it as a copy then it may well be 
relevant that he was involved in making diplomatic exchanges 
of works of art in 1620 with the grand duke of Tuscany, as 
Michael Vickers has pointed out, for the grand duke's 
permission would probably have been required for such a 
copy to be made.


142. Pope enthroned, extending his hand in benediction
24.1 cms. (height)
Terracotta with a grey and brown colour partially achieved by soot 
or a similar substance worked into the surface of the clay before 
firing. The interior of the model reveals a clay of a beige colour. 
(When a sample was drilled in 1986 the clay was found to be unusually 

soft and pale.) The model has been hollowed out from below to 
about 6 cms. The pope's right hand has been broken at the wrist 
and reattached. The first two fingers of the same hand have been 
broken off and are missing. The handling is very rough and exhibits 
fingerprints in many places.
Bought from Dr Alfred Scharf in 1952. Registered on 19 March. 
Said to come from the collection of Mrs C. K. Norman. A 
photograph dated 1966 shows it in a pedestal case in the Fox
Strangways Gallery. It has been in reserve for at least a decade.
Although entered in the Register as a sculpture by a `follower 
of G. L. Bernini' this was followed by the name of Algardi 
with a question mark and by the time Parker compiled the 
Annual Report for 1952 (p. 51) he had decided that the 

sculpture was a bozzetto by Algardi for his great bronze statue 
of Pope Innocent X commissioned in 1645 and completed 
in 1649 for the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome (for this 
sculpture see J. Montagu, Alessandro Algardi, 2 vols. (New 
Haven, Conn., and London, 1985), ii. 428, no. 152). He 
associated it with the terracotta (40 cms. high) in the 
Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (ibid. ii. 429, 
no. 152.B.1), and found in it `great dramatic force and 
masterly execution'.
The terracotta in Vienna is of very different character. The 
Ashmolean's sketch should be connected with a sketch 
purporting to be a bozzetto for Bernini's statue of Pope Urban 
VIII advertised in Apollo for October 1967 by David Peel 
and Co. Ltd. of 2 Carlos Place, Mount Street, London W1, 
and there are other small sketchy versions of famous baroque 
sculptures, often with variations intended to suggest 
abandoned preliminary ideas, which are exciting to art 
historians. In the Ashmolean sketch, Jennifer Montagu justly 
observed, in a letter to Gerald Taylor of 27 January 1982, 
`the modelling is dry and rather sketchy, whereas his 
[Algardi's] terracottas all have a marvellous fluidity'. She also 
pointed out that the sculptor of this work seems to have no 
real knowledge of Innocent's appearance, the bumps on his 
forehead and the unpointed beard, with which Algardi would 
have been very familiar. Samples were taken from the 
terracotta in August 1973 and October 1986 by Mrs Doreen 
Stoneham of the Oxford University Research Laboratory for 
Archaeology and the History of Art and thermoluminescence 
dating indicated on both occasions that the piece was fired 
less than 150 years ago (ref. 81m66 and 381y30).

143. Hercules (or Samson) tearing 
open the jaws of a lion
19.2 cms. (height)
Bronze with a dark varnish, now black, worn on salient points_
e.g. chest, nose, chin_to expose a coppery metal with a warm 
brown natural patina. Hollow, lostwax, cast with very thin walls. 
Assembled from several separately cast pieces. There are firing crack 
s 
in the lion's back left leg. Much of the core remains and some 
chaplets are visible in the hero's left leg. A substance resembling 
core seems to have been poured into the body of the lion possibly 
to weight and consolidate the piece. The hero's right arm is 
separately cast and the join below the shoulder is clearly visible. T 
he 
hero's left hand is cast together with the lion's jaw_the join at the 

wrist is clearly visible. The hero's left leg is separately cast_the 

drapery is intended to conceal the join but does not quite succeed 
in doing so. Solder reinforcing this join has recently cracked and th 
e 
leg is loose. The remainder of the hero's body is cast in one piece 
and attached to the back of the lion_a smeared line of solder is just 

visible beside the lower leg. The bronze is extensively tooled, most 

obviously on the lion's fell.
Given by Mrs Gutekunst in memory of her husband the art dealer 
Otto Gutekunst, 1953. Registered on 15 July. The bronze had 
been bought in at Christie's, London, 25 June 1953, where it was 
lot 15. An old photograph (by Henry Dixon and Son of Albany 
Street) showing the bronze when it was in Otto Gutekunst's 
collection reveals that it was placed on a block of dark marble with 

sparse white veins (perhaps russet Tuscan marble) with an 
approximate rectangular base of bronze or bronzed plaster given 
the texture of rough soil below the group. The group is now 
mounted on a walnut base adapted from that designed by 
Michelangelo for the Marcus Aurelius.
This bronze group is generally supposed to represent Hercules 
in combat with the Nemean Lion, but it possibly represents 
Samson in the lion's den. The group is known in many 
versions. It is generally catalogued as an inkstand but some 
versions include a tongue in the lion's mouth, and, even in 
those that do not (such as this example), it is hard to imagine 
the nature of the vessel which would fit securely or snugly 
between the animal's jaws. Moreover a secure platform was 
an obvious precondition for an inkstand and yet few of these 
groups seem to retain their original base.
The group was considered to date from the late fifteenth 
century and has been associated with the Hercules and the 
Nemean Lion painted by Antonio del Pollaiuolo in Palazzo 
Medici by Planiscig, Hackenbroch, Ettlinger, and others, but, 
as Anthony Radcliffe has pointed out (`Two Bronzes from 
the Circle of Bernini', Apollo (Dec. 1978), 420), Vasari's 
description of that celebrated lost work strongly suggests that 
the combat was conceived of by Pollaiuolo as face to face. It 
is, however, easy to see why the group has been associated 
with the strenuous and expressive tendencies in late fifteenth 
and early sixteentcentury Italian art to which Pollaiuolo 
contributed so much. The desperate grimace of the hero may 
be compared with the face of Riccio's Shouting Horseman 
(Victoria and Albert Museum) or of his penitential St Jerome 
(Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem) or of the Paduan 
candlestand with a screaming Triton bitten by a serpent 
(MusÃ©e du Louvre, OA. 6942; Staatliche Museen, Berlin
Dahlem, 39/107).
Radcliffe's claim that the group has a distinctively 
seventeenthcentury character is not entirely convincing, 
although it certainly could have been invented at that date. 
From the similarities between the version of the group in the 
Cottonian Collection, Plymouth City Art Gallery, and the lion 
supporters of a base for a miniature bust of Paolo Giordano 
II Orsini, duke of Bracciano, in the same collection, which is 
inscribed as cast by Bernardino Danese of Rome in 1675, 
Radcliffe proposed that the former group might have been 
cast by Danese from his own model (ibid. 418-23). (Danese 
is known to have been active casting sculptural elements for 

Bernini's Capella del Sacramento in St Peter's between 1673 
and 1675). The similarities with the base of the Orsini bust 
do not seem sufficiently strong to support the first part of 
this hypothesis and no evidence of Danese's ability as a 
modeller has been found. In style, technique, and finish the 
bronze statuette of St Sebastian (No. 144) also given to the 
Museum by Mrs Gutekunst provides a striking comparison 
but little help with dating.
The earliest probable reference to the bronze known to me 
is that in the posthumous inventory of the collection of AndrÃ© 
Le No~7tre, which includes a pair of bronzes of `Herculles quy 
Ã©gorge le lion' valued at 60 livres and a smaller bronze of the 
same subject valued at 40 livres (J. Guiffrey, `Testament et 
inventaire apre~6s dÃ©ce~6s de AndrÃ© Le Nostre et autres 
documents le concernant', Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de l'Histoire 
de l'Art Fran}ais (1911), 258, nos. 367 and 368). The only 
version of the group which is known to have an old provenance 
is that in Plymouth (Radcliffe, op. cit., fig. 5), which was 
purchased at Christie's, London, on 28 January 1772 at the 
sale of the Machese Leonori of Pesaro, lot 31 (as by Algardi). 
No scholar has ever considered the group as originating 
outside Italy (although it should be pointed out that many 
of Le No~7tre's bronzes are thought to have been of French 
origin).
The Ashmolean's group may be associated with the versions 
in the collection of William Newall (sold Christie's, London, 
27 June 1922, lot 73, illustrated), Plymouth (Radcliffe,
op. cit., fig. 5), the Victoria and Albert Museum (55431859, 
ibid. fig. 7), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (44591), 
the Wernher Collection, Luton Hoo (480), the Metropolitan 
Museum, New York (198260107, published by J. D. Draper 
in The Jack and Belle Linsky Collection (New York, 1984), 
no. 74), the Untermyer Collection (briefly in the Metropolitan 
Museum, New York, published by Y. Hackenbroch, Bronzes, 
Other Metalwork and Sculpture in the Irwin Untermyer 
Collection (London, 1962), p. xxiv, fig. 47), the Lisbon 
Museum of Ancient Art (reproduced when in the Gulbenkian 
Collection in Connoisseur (May 1956), 230, fig. 1), and the 
City Art Gallery, Manchester (1982136). These vary greatly 
in condition and finish. There are traces of gilding only in 
the Houston version. Most have traces of dark varnish. All 
seem to be composite casts but to have been assembled with 
varying skill and in slightly different ways_the right foot of 
the hero in the rather poor version in Manchester for example 
is half way down the side of the lion rather than resting on 
its back. The Plymouth and Victoria and Albert Museum 
bronzes have textured fell and loincloth, whereas in the 
Ashmolean and Metropolitan Museum versions the fell alone 
is textured. The lions' tails are differently fitted and have 
sometimes been detached. The versions in the Metropolitan 
Museum, Manchester, Luton Hoo, and the Victoria and 
Albert Museum all have tongues. The eyeballs are marked 
with unusual distinctness in the Ashmolean bronze.
There are also versions of the group which appear to have 

been made from different models which are relatively 
unenergetic in both pose and expression. One such is in the 
Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 1521910, reproduced in 
W. Bode, Italian Renaissance Bronze Statuettes of the 
Renaissance (London, 1902), p. xxiv, no. 48) which is 
perhaps made from a modified aftercast. Another example was 
in the Untermyer Collection (Hackenbroch, op. cit., fig. 48, 
not to be confused with fig. 47 mentioned above but like it 
sold by the Metropolitan Museum), and looks more like an 
inept imitation, as does the group which was lot 123 at 
Christie's, London, December 1989.
In even the best casts, such as the Ashmolean's, the 
execution seems unworthy of the conception, and one must 
suspect that the original has been lost. Perhaps it was made 
of silver.


144. St Sebastian
26.5 cms. (height including integral base; 9.75 cms. (length of 
base; 10.3 cms. (width of base); 2.6 cms. (height of plinth); 
11.5 cms. (length and width of plinth)
Bronze with a blackened varnish rubbed off in parts (especially the 
sides of the legs and the back of the saint's left arm) to expose the 

natural chestnut patina of a coppery alloy. Hollow, lostwax, cast 
with thin walls. There are firing cracks at the base. The bronze is 
attached to a plinth of serpentine with a spinachy pattern.
Given by Mrs Gutekunst in 1953 in memory of her husband the 
dealer Otto Gutekunst. Registered on 15 July. The bronze had 
been bought in at Christie's, London, 25 June 1953, where it was 
lot 12 (together with its present base). The bronze was already in 
the Gutekunst Collection in 1912 when the bronze was published 
by W. Bode in Italian Renaissance Bronze Statuettes (1912), iii, 
pl. CCLVI.
Bode regarded this bronze as Italian, probably Venetian, of 
the early sixteenth century (op. cit. under provenance) as did 
Planiscig (Piccoli bronzi italiani del Rinascimento (Milan, 
1930), pl. CXXXV, no. 236), and this opinion was echoed 
in the Annual Report (1953: 53), with the additional 
suggestion that it might possibly be a work of the Spanish 
school. Another example of the bronze was in the sale of the 
Henry Harris Collection, Sotheby's, London, 24 October 
1950, lot 72. And one with a differently shaped base and 
retaining two arrows is in the Victoria and Albert Museum 
(Hildburgh Collection, A. 1111956). James Draper in his 
annotated reprint of Bode observes of the Ashmolean bronze 
that it is of `unknown facture, possibly 19th century'. In the 
character of the cast, its colour, and rough surface, combined 
with some tooling, and in the dynamic but ungainly torsion 
of the figure, with crudely modelled extremities, highly 
expressive uplifted head, roughly striated curls and beard, the 
bronze figure is very similar to the Hercules (or Samson) also 
from the Gutekunst Collection (No. 143). This contorted 
manner of depicting St Sebastian, reflecting the varied poses 

employed for the thieves crucifed beside Christ, seems to have 
become popular in the seventeenth century.

145. Ecce Homo
15.6 cms. (height including integral base); 3 cms. (height of 
plinth); 5.7 cms. (length and width of plinth)
Bronze, firegilt. The gilding is worn in some salient areas and 
scratched in others, exposing the natural chestnut patina of a 
coppery alloy. Hollow, lostwax, cast. There is a large round hole 
in the drapery in the centre of the figure's back and smaller ones 
on the crown and in the back of the head (presumably for fixing a 
halo). There is also a smaller threaded hole beside the thumb and 
index finger of his right hand. The outside of the cloak and the loin 

cloth have been textured with the same punch. There is a threaded 
tang soldered to the small integrally cast oval base. The tang is 
inserted into an ebonized wooden plinth. `M. 171' is painted in 
black on the drapery behind the figure.
Bequeathed by John Francis Mallett who died 7 January 1947. 
Received in the Museum during the last week in May 1947. 171 
in the inventory of his bequest.
The bronze was catalogued by Mallett as Italian of the 
sixteenth century, but it is more likely to date from the 
seventeenth century. It must have been part of a group 
presumably on a miniature altar.



146. St Catherine of Alexandria
14.7 cms. (height)
Bronze with a natural tan patina. Hollow, very thinwalled, lost
wax, cast. No evidence of tooling. The surfaces are very rough and 
there is a firing crack through the wheel. Parts of the wheel may als 
o 
be lost, although it was of course intended to be broken. An abrupt 
termination of the drapery above the figure's left hand may also be 
a loss caused by a firing crack. There are six square holes: by the 
saint's left knee, right breast, and right shin, in her back near her 

left shoulder, in the drapery behind her left shoulder, and behind he 
r 
right knee. These must have been caused by chaplet pins and they 
may once have been filled, as a hole appears to have been filled on 
top of the figure's head, but plugs would easily be shaken out of a 
wall of bronze as thin as this. The integral plinth is filled with pl 
aster 
of Paris as a weight. `B. 428. ' is painted in white on the side of 
the plinth behind the figure.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. B. 428 in his 
catalogues. Bought in Florence in 1867, according to the large 
catalogue, from Gagliardi according to the earlier notebook 
catalogue, for Â£2.
Fortnum regarded this as a cast from a rough wax sketch by 
a seventeenthcentury artist in Italy, perhaps `Maderna or 

Fiamingo'. The roughness is not, in fact, much in excess of 
that often found in bronzes by Fanelli which, since they were 
repeated, are not likely to be attempts to preserve bozzetti 
(and indeed the whole idea of bronzes designed to perpetuate 
sketches in this manner is anachronistic_the practice was 
exceptional before the end of the last century). Anthony 
Radcliffe has suggested that this particular figure is by Fanelli 
and associates it with two other bronze saints he has seen, one 
belonging to an anonymous collector and the other in the 
collection of Sir Brinsley Ford. They might have formed part 
of a set on a cabinet or domestic altar. In any case Fortnum 
was surely right to suspect that this reflects some more 
monumental work by a major sculptor. The pose has a sweep 
combined with a daintiness and elegance which suggests a 
later date than the artists he had in mind.
The version in the Ford Collection is the same size (allowing 
for a slightly less high plinth). It differs from the Ashmolean's 
bronze in the tilting of the head and in the position of the 
right arm and absence of any attribute. The rough unchiselled 
character is the same and it even has holes (from the chaplet 
pins) in the same places. It was bought by Richard Ford at 
the sale of Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection.



147. Nymph feeding a child from a 
horn
29.2 cms. (height); 24.3 cms. (width); 33.7 cms. (height of 
outside of frame); 28.4 cms. (width of outside of frame)
Terracotta of a pale beige colour. Much of the lower half of the 
moulding at the proper right edge has been broken off and replaced 
with plaster. An equivalent loss at the top edge has not been replace 
d. 
Some chips on the other edges have been patched with plaster but 
most have been left. The head of the serpent coiled around the tree 
trunk has been broken off and lost. A circular hole in the body of 
the serpent suggests that a repair was attempted. The right forearm 
of the infant satyr has been broken off and lost: only an iron wire 
remains from a plaster repair. His left forearm and his lower left le 
g 
(but not the foot) are old repairs in plaster. The heads of the 
standing goat, of the birds in the nest, and of the mother bird above 

them, also the drinking infant's left foot and a wing of the bird abo 
ve 
the nymph's head, have been broken off and lost. The surface of the 
relief is mottled with mould and in a few parts the hard `fire skin' 
of 
the terracotta has flaked off (this is most notable in the right fore 
arm 
of the nymph). Framed in a dark oak moulding (probably original).
Presumably transferred during this century from the Department of 
Antiquities. The Benefactions Book of the Ashmolean Museum 
records that the relief was given by `Harries' an `Armiger' of

Worcestershire in 1693: `AD MDCXCIII. Ornatissimus Vir D.
Harries de in agro wigorniensi armiger, donavit elegantissimam 
Tabellam Plasticam, in qua~6 felici manu exhibetur JOVIS Historia in 

CretÃ¢ insula enutriti Amalthaea scilicet nutrix sub elata quadam 
arbore, in eremo conspicitur; lacte repletum Cornu Copiae ad os

alta~6 rupe eriscerans aquila. Quin et in summÃ¢ arbore, pulli aquil 
ini 
in nido delitescunt, quibus serpens arborem ascendens, exitium 
denunciat.' The subjectmatter and provenance had been forgotten 
and the medium mistaken by 1836 when it appears in A Catalogue 
of the Ashmolean Museum Descriptive of the Zoological Specimens . . . 

as `A Cast in plaister, representing a female figure holding a 
cornucopiae from which a child is drinking, &c.' (146, no. 493).
This relief is a copy after an antique Roman marble relief. 
That such terracotta copies were made in Rome in the 
seventeenth century is amply documented in the notebooks 
of Nicholas Stone the Younger (W. L. Spiers (ed.), `Diary 
and Notebooks made in Italy', Walpole Society, (1918-19), 
193-200), but no other examples certainly dating from that 
period are known to me in British collections. The copy is 
not entirely accurate. Above all, in the marble original (for 
which, see below) the rocks form an arch behind the infant 
satyr, presumably indicating the entrance of a cave. The 
composition has been somewhat compressed to fit into a neat 
rectangle. Other differences are due to ignorant restoration
(e.g. the child satyr held a horn in his left hand).

The marble original was said to have been discovered in 
the digging of the foundations of Palazzo Giustiniani and 
was first published by Pietro Santi Bartoli in his Admiranda 
Romanorum antiquitatum in the 1670s with a note by 
Bellori identifying the subject and reflecting that the birds 
were an embellishment added by the sculptor. Bernard de 
Montfaucon in his AntiquitÃ© expliquÃ©e (i. i (Paris, 1963), 32-
3, pl. VII) gave it priority as an ancient representation of the 
earliest years of the first of the gods. The eagle (eating a hare 
on the rocks above the satyr) was the bird of Jupiter and 
confirmed the subject, but he was puzzled by the other birds 
defending their young against the serpent and echoed Bellori 
in suggesting that they `paroissent n'e~7tre la~6 que pour 
l'ornement'. From the Giustiniani Collection the relief passed 
into that of Lucien Bonaparte before being acquired by Pope 
Pius VII for the Papal Collections. It was placed in the 
Appartamenti Borgia of the Vatican Palace before being 
moved to the Lateran Museum where it was catalogued in 
1863 as the `socalled Amalthea relief' in deference to the 
scepticism expressed by a relay of scholars over the previous 
halfcentury (O. Benndorf and R. SchÃ¶ne, Die antiken 
Bildwerke des Lateranensischen Museums (Leipzig, 1867), 
16-18, no. 24).
The identity of the donor, Harries, a gentleman who had 

presumably been on the Grand Tour, remains a mystery.



148. Ornamental crucifix
44.5 cms. (height); 24.5 cms. (width); 9 cms. (height of Corpus); 
7.4 cms. (width of Corpus)
The Corpus is carved out of coral. The proper right leg and both 
arms are made from separate pieces. The proper right foot is 
restored. The back of the Cross consists of a plain sheet of brass. 
Upon this is a brass sheet perforated and set with quatrefoil flower 

heads, radial petals, and smaller, tearshaped pellets, all of coral. 
The 
cresting along the edges of the Cross consists of short lengths of 
brass each decorated with white enamel: the foliate scrolls at the 
extremity of each arm of the Cross are also of brass with white 
enamel ornament.
Bequeathed by Mary Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale of
9 The Vale, Chelsea (1896-1966), in memory of her father, the 
first Marquess Curzon, Chancellor of the University of Oxford 
1907-25. Registered 2 June 1966. The bequest of Lady Ravensdale 
consisted of 115 items, mostly pectoral crosses. This is unlike any 
other item in her collection. In her autobiography (In Many 
Rhythms (London, 1953), 122) she wrote of how a `vile Russian 
Customs Official' broke the `coral feet of the Christ on the Crucifix 

I had bought in Leningrad'.
The crucifix was originally displayed in the Museum as `early 
seventeenthcentury Spanish'. Work in coral of this character 
was made in Sicily, especially at Trapani, in the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. The Arte dei corallari, the guild of 
coral workers, was established there in 1628. The skilled 
workers were dispersed to other Mediterranean centres after 
the repression of the insurrection in Trapani in 1672. Similar 
devotional pieces with clumsy miniature sculptures and 
densely but undynamically patterned with tiny pieces of coral 
and enamel are not uncommon on the art market_see, for 
instance, lot 195, 12 December 1985; lot 67, 3 July 1986; 
lot 491, 8 December 1988; lot 256, 20 April 1989, at 
Sotheby's, London. There are three pieces of this work 
displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum (M. 157, 
M. 159 and M. 2181956). A number of such pieces, secular 
as well as devotional, were included in the exhibition Civilta~6 
del seicento a Napoli (Museo di Capodimonte and Museo 
Pignatelli, Naples, 1984-5), including a piatto and vassoio 
from the Museo di San Martino, Naples, which has similar 
arrangements of tearshaped coral pellets and similar flower
heads of coral and white enamel and, in the latter case, similar 
scrolled cresting (nos. 5.33 and 5.39). The catalogue includes 
a general discussion of such work by Gina Carla Ascione (ibid. 
ii. 336-41), as does her book Gloria del Corallo a Napoli dal 
XVI al XIX secolo (Naples, 1991).

149. Bust portrait of Plato
28.2 cms. (height including tablet); 2.6 cms. (height of tablet); 
3.6 cms. (width of tablet)
Bronze with a deteriorated dull grey and green patina, due to damp 
storage. There are traces of a ruddy golden varnish most evident 
on the neck. Hollow, lostwax, cast. The bronze has been extensively 

tooled. Hair, beard, eyebrows, and the blank eyeballs have been 
textured with a punch. Part of the integral tablet below the chest 
has been cracked off and lost. Some remains of solder suggested a 
botched attempt at mending this. The punched ground of the tablet 
has been partly chiselled away. On the remaining ground the edge 
of a `T' and an `O' remain from the name Plato originally chiselled 
there.
Presumably transferred from the Department of Antiquities. Adolf 
Michaelis, when cataloguing Oxford's ancient sculpture (Ancient 
Marbles in Great Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 592, no. 233) 
observed that this was a sculpture which he `could not find' or had 
`overlooked'. The basement was dark, the sculptures covered in 
dust and illarranged, and Michaelis was in a hurry, but it is possib 
le 
that the bust was, at the date of his visit, in the Bodleian Library 
or 
some other location. Bequeathed to the University by Dr Richard 
Rawlinson; for whom see No. 151. The engraving in Chandler's 
Marmora Oxoniensia (Oxford, 1763), i, pl. XLV, no. C11) shows 
the tablet complete and the letters chiselled on it as PL . . O. The 

third and fourth letters appear as if deleted. There is a turned socl 
e 
below this, but it does not look likely to have been an original one. 

The bust may well have been one of the `Fine Brass Heads' included 
in the `Collection of the Right Honourable Edward Earl of Oxford, 
Deceas'd' auctioned by Mr Cock, London, 8 March and following 
days 1741/2, from which Rawlinson is known to have acquired 
much.
Michaelis (op. cit.) correctly observed of this bust, which he 
knew only from the plate in Chandler's Marmora Oxoniensia, 
that it was `apparently a copy of the Florentine bust' of Plato. 
This Florentine bust is a small marble portrait (35 cms. high) 
long believed to represent Plato. It is now in Palazzo Medici
Riccardi, Florence, but was formerly in the Sala delle Iscrizioni 
of the Uffizi. For a long time it was considered to be the bust 
of Plato from Athens which Girolamo Rossi of Pistoia is 
recorded as presenting to Lorenzo il Magnifico, but that bust 
passed to the University of Pisa and there is no record of
it returning to the Grand Ducal Collections in the Uffizi
(G. Bencivenni, gia~6 Pelli, Saggio istorico della Real Galleria di 
Firenze, i (Florence, 1779), 26; G. Mansuelli, Galleria degli 
Uffizi: Le sculture, ii (Florence, 1961), 21, no. 2). The first 
certain record of the little Florentine bust of Plato is in fact 
an illustration (generally numbered 27) in Pietro Santi 

Bartoli's Admiranda Romanorum antiquitatum, first 
published in Rome in the mid1670s with notes by Bellori.
This bronze copy which seems originally to have had a 
patina typical of Florentine bronzes was no doubt made in 
Florence in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. 
The marble bust has a tablet below the chest, but rather 
broader than the one in this bronze copy. It is chiselled with 
the name of Plato in Greek letters but the antiquity of the 
inscription was challenged in the midnineteenth century and 
doubts as to the identity followed. Richter observes that no 
other ancient portrait of Plato gives him a tuft of beard below 
the lower lip, symmetrical swags of flesh in the lower neck, 
and so little hair on the centre of his head (G. M. A. Richter, 
The Portraits of the Greeks, 3 vols. (London, 1965), i. 168). 
Because the restorations to the upper lip and nose of the 
Florentine bust have been removed the illustrations in 
Mansuelli (op. cit., fig. 3) and Richter (op. cit., fig. 966) are 
less valuable for comparison with the bronze than that in
J. J. Bernouilli, Griechische Ikonographie (Munich, 1901), ii, 
fig. 2 and E. Q. Visconti, Iconografie grecque (Paris, 1808), 
i, pl. XVIII.



150. Profile bust portrait of Pope 
Innocent XIII
29.6 cms. (height); 18.3 cms. (width)
Carrara marble, discoloured by dirt. There are slight scratches on 
many parts of the surface and chips to the edges. `Mavosi' is chisell 
ed 
lightly below the chest (where it has been cut). Some of the letters, 

especially the third and fifth, are not clear.
No provenance is recorded.
The portrait has been described in the Department's records 
as of `an ecclesiastic', but only a pope would be represented 
wearing the mozzetta (a short, hooded, buttoned cape) and 
cap. The porcine features, so exaggerated, or at least so 
unmodified, might suggest caricature were it not for the 
affable expression on the face. The dove hovering against a 
background of flames depicted in rilievo schiacciato on the 
stole does not, it seems, help to identify the sitter, but there 
can be little doubt that this is the amiable and fat Innocent 
XIII (Michelangelo de' Conti, b. 1655, elected 1721, 
d. 1724). Comparison may be made with the posthumous 
portrait of this pope by Claus in the Ashmolean (No. 23). 
No sculptor by the name of Mavosi has been recorded and 
the inscription may not be intended as a signature.

151. Profile head and shoulders of 
a laurelcrowned hero
28.7 cms. (height); 20.5 cms. (width)
White marble of uncertain type, now dark grey with dirt and 
scratched. The relief is partially abraded most noticeably in the are 

as 
of highest relief, possibly from exposure to the elements. The losses 

to top right and lower left are consistent with the injudicious prisi 
ng 
of the relief from a wall into which it had been cemented. The edges 

may not however be original: that to proper right would not, if 
continued, contain the projecting portion of relief below it.
Transferred from the Department of Antiquities in 1986. The relief 
was moved to the basement of the University Galleries early in 1888 
from the basement of the Old Ashmolean Museum. It had probably 
been kept during the eighteenth century in the Bodleian Library. 
In 1763 when published in Chandler's Marmora Oxoniensia, i,
pl. XLIV, no. XCII, the relief was unbroken and framed with pilaster 

strips decorated with ribbon ornament and a substantial plinth and 
entablature. Bequeathed to the University by Dr Richard Rawlinson, 
Gentleman Commoner of St John's College (MA 1713, Hon. DCL 
1719), a keen antiquary and avid collector in many fields, who died 
in 1755. Rawlinson had been a severe critic of the management of 
the Ashmolean Museum and established in his will a fund to pay 
for a proper keeper of it (who was to be neither a Scotsman nor in 
holy orders). He also bequeathed a few trifles to it (including a 
model gondola and a Muscovian fox). Rawlinson `had formed his 
collection [of classical marbles], in which there was certainly a goo 
d 
deal of rubbish, principally at the Kemp sale and the Oxford sale' 
(A. Michaelis, Ancient Marbles in Great Britain (Cambridge, 
1882), 539; Chandler, op. cit., pp. V-VI). The sale of John Kemp 
FRS was in March 1720/1 (the catalogue, by R. Ainsworth was 
entitled Momumenta vetustatis Kempiana (London, 1920)) and 
that of the earl of Oxford was in March 1741/2.
Michaelis in his late nineteenthcentury catalogue of the 
antique marbles in Oxford (op. cit. 591, no. 222 observed 
merely that this relief is `new', by which he meant not ancient, 
as had been assumed by Chandler in the eighteenth century 
(op. cit. i, pl. XLIV, no. XCII). It is likely to be Italian and 
possibly sixteenth or seventeenth century, but more probably 
early eighteenth century, in date. The style of hair and 
youthful, blandly idealized profile suggests the numerous 
portraits of Augustus. There are similar low relief crowned 
heads in profile in the second plane of the ancient Roman 
relief sculpture representing processions and triumphs: the 
head immediately in front of the emperor's chariot in one of 
the reliefs in the interior of the Arch of Titus (c. AD 90) and 
several heads in the relief of the Vicomagistri (AD 41-50) in 
the Museo Gregoriano Profano are convenient examples.

152. Farnese Hercules
56.4 cms. (height including plinth, but excluding the rough 
projection beneath it); 3 cms. (height of plinth at back); 22.8 cms. 

(length of plinth); 20.6 cms. (width of plinth); 4.8 cms. (height 

of rough projection below the plinth)
Terracotta of a pale biscuit colour. Solid. The hero's head, arms, le 
ft 
leg (at knee), and right leg (at lower thigh), also the drapery behin 
d 
the club and the base beside the feet, have been broken off and 
replaced with a plaster cement which is very evident. Chips are 
missing along the joins. The hands have been broken off. This right 
arm now terminates in a stump and his left has a crudely modelled 
substitute hand. `9427 / 1936 / C.Gg' is painted in black on the 
underside of the plinth at the back.
Transferred from the Department of Antiquities, after the refixing 
of some of the repairs, in August 1987. The terracotta was one of 
numerous objects (chiefly flints, amulets, and gem impressions) 
which were transferred from the Wellcome Institute for the History 
of Medicine to the Department of Antiquities on 29 June 1982 
(after an agreement reached in November 1981). Eric J. Freeman, 
Librarian of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, 
wrote on 3 December 1987, in reply to enquiries concerning the 
provenance, that the terracotta must have come from the Gorga 
Collection (hence `C.Gg'). Wellcome purchased the collection of 
medical and other antiquities formed by Signor Evan Gorga of 285 
Via Cola di Rienzo, Rome, in 1924 (having first made overtures to 
do so in February 1912). The figure is likely to be the `Terra cotta 

statuette (Hercules) W. 67' in the list of `cases and contents' made 

in Rome in 1924. There were, however, over 300 terracotta items 
in the collection and at least one other terracotta Hercules.
The terracotta is a copy of the famous antique statue in the 
Farnese Collection of Hercules resting after his labours. It 
could have been made in the seventeenth, eighteenth, or 
nineteenth century. There is another, slightly smaller, 
terracotta copy of the Hercules signed by Maderno in the 
Ashmolean (No. 56), also a large and small bronze copy 
(Nos. 414, 416). This is less sharply modelled and less detailed 
than the Maderno and in some respects is closer to the 
original, although of little artistic merit.

153 and 154. Hercules slaying the 
Erymanthian Boar and Hercules 
slaying Geryon
26 cms. (height of No. 153); 27 cms. (height of No. 154)
Terracotta. There are breaks across the base by the hero's left foot 

in No. 154, also in his raised right arm across biceps and wrist. 
These have been mended, but are conspicuous. There are traces of 
gilding on the lion skin and the boar in No. 153 and also on parts 
of No. 154. Both groups are unfinished from behind and appear to 
have been scraped down. No. 153 has on the underside of its base 
the following in blue pencil `No 1818' and on a circular label in bir 
o 
`8976'. No. 154 has in the same place some indecipherable marks 
in blue pencil and on a circular label in biro `8977'.

Bought from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf), The Royal Arcade, 
28 Old Bond Street, London W1. Registered 12 December 1960.
The bozzetti were registered as possibly by Vincenzo de Rossi 
and described soon afterwards, in the Annual Report (1960: 
63) as follows:
Their tense muscular action and vigorous contrapposto recall the styl 
e 
of Bandinelli's pupil, Vincenzo de' Rossi (1525-1587), who was 
commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici to execute the Twelve Labours 
of Hercules in marble and larger than life. Work on the series was 
in progress in the Opera del Duomo by 1563 and two of the finished 
groups were praised by Vasari in the 1568 edition of his Lives. Six 
of the seven marbles completed, including versions of Geryon and 
the Boar, still stand, as they were arranged in 1592, along opposite 

walls of the Salone del Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio.
For this series of sculptures see H. Utz, `The Labors of 
Hercules and Other Works by Vincenzo de' Rossi', Art 
Bulletin (Sept. 1971), 344-6, where, however, these bozzetti 
are not mentioned, Professor Utz having expressed his 
opinion, on seeing photographs of the groups, that they had 
`nothing in common' with sculpture by de' Rossi. He thought 
that they might be connected with a minor sculptor in the 
circle of Romulo del Tadda who was responsible for the 
groups carved in pietra serena which were placed around the 
bolotto of the Boboli Gardens (letter of 13 April 1971 in the 
Department's Archive). Professor Ulrich Middeldorf had also 
questioned the connection with de' Rossi as early as 23 June 
1961, writing to Ian Robertson: `The Labours of Hercules 
have nothing to do with Bandinelli or Vincenzo de' Rossi . . . 
They are as to period certainly closer to Maderno; but his 
groups have different proportions, movements and detail' 
(letter in the Department's Archive).
There is surely no reason why the groups should not date 
from the seveteenth or eighteenth century, nor is there any 
reason for them to be Florentine, for, although the Labours 
were especially popular subjects there in the fifteenth and 
sixteenth century, they were popular all over Italy as well: 
there are seventeenth and eighteenthcentury examples in or 
from the Veneto which are similar in character and conceived 
for niches (or at least to be placed against a wall or hedge)_
a pair of crude Istrian stone groups of Hercules clubbing 
Cerberus and tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion now flank 
the entrance of Palazzo Pisani in Venice; others may be seen 
in the grounds of villas in the Veneto; an impressive Hercules 
and the Hydra signed by Giovanni Marchiori and probably 
of about 1760 is in a private collection (F. Russell, `A Statue 
of Hercules and the Hydra by Giovanni Marchiori', 
Burlington Magazine (June 1972), 393 and fig. 58).
A sample from both terracotta groups was examined by 
thermoluminescence at the Oxford Research Laboratory for 
Art and Archaeology in October 1986 and estimated as fired 
between 240 and 370 years ago (ref. 381y36).


155. Bust of a black boy wearing a 
tasselled cap and frogged doublet
28.4 cms. (height); 20.6 cms. (length, across sleeves); 12.3 cms. 
(height of socle); 13.2 cms. (diameter of base of socle)
Bronze with a natural chestnut coloured patina exposed, especially 
in the face, beneath coloured varnishes. The flesh is varnished black 
; 
the cap a dark blackgreen; the kerchief, shirt, part of the eyes, an 
d 
one tooth white; the kerchief ribbon and lips red. The varnishes 
have chipped off or worn through in parts and have darkened in 
colour. The doublet was covered with a gold varnish as were parts 
of the cap: this is best preserved at the back of the ball attached t 
o 
the cap's tassell and in the ribbon attaching the feathers. Hollow, 
heavywalled, lostwax, cast. Some flaws in the lower part of the 
chest. The bust is open at the back of the chest and the head has 
been filled with plaster. An old iron file embedded in the latter 
extends to a waisted spreading socle of verde di prato (Tuscan 
serpentine).
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the 
same year. B. 402 in his catalogues. According to the notebook 
catalogue it was bought in 1860 for Â£6 (the date but not the price 
is given in the large catalogue). The bronze has long been in reserve 
.
Fortnum described this remarkable bronze as `n. Italian, 
probably Venetian'. Blacks of course played a large part in 
Venetian art. He dated it to the sixteenth century, although 
a later date seems more likely. Aileen Ribeiro considers it 
likely that it dates from the early eighteenth century and notes 
that a livery combining `hussar' and `Vandyck' elements was 
popular for servants then. The varnishes look old but may not 
be original. That on the cap conceals the very carefully 
punched foliate pattern and the textured contrast of the lining 
which is turned over at the back. The socle, recorded in 
Fortnum's catalogues, cannot be original.


156. Virgin and Child with a 
crescent moon
56 cms. (height); 64 cms. (length; 30.9 cms. (height of oval relief 
within oval frame); 26 cms. (width of relief within oval frame); 
18.2 cms. (height of Virgin from top of head to the sleeve below 
the wrist)
The relief of the Virgin and Child is certainly of terracotta. The 
framework has been described as of stone but seems also to be of 
terracotta. The rear of the relief is made up with lath and plaster a 
nd 
some bricks. The Virgin is clothed in red with a blue cloak. The 
ground against which the swags are set is a green blue and there are 

traces of green on the ground around the oval. But most colouring 
has darkened and flaked. Much seems also to have been distressed.
Bought from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf), The Royal Arcade, 

28 Old Bond Street, London W1, in 1964. Registered immediately 
after the terracotta relief attributed to Mazza (No. 78) without a 
date but between 10 and 16 June. The relief is shown in photographs 
dated 1966 high on the wall of the Fox Strangways Gallery. It has 
long been in reserve.
The relief was associated by Ian Robertson with Giuseppe 
Mazza because of its supposed similarity to the terracotta 
relief of the Virgin and Child which he bought at about the 
same time (No. 78), although he conceded that it was `less 
masterly in modelling' (Annual Report (1964), 51). The relief 
certainly looks Italian and of the seventeenth or eighteenth 
century. The architectural framework, colouring, and material 
would suggest that this originated as a popular street shrine. 
The removal of such, however, was not easily achieved even 
in the upheavals at the end of the Second World War. Work 
of this character and of such moderate quality is easily imitated.

157. A young martyr stoned and 
beaten
31.5 cms. (height); 43.3 cms. (length); 41.5 cms. (outside height 
of frame); 53.5 cms. (outside width of frame)
Terracotta of a pale orange colour coated with a yellowish grey slip 

which has been rubbed to a warm brown on some salient parts 
(such as the buttocks of the flagellator and the foreheads of the mos 
t 
prominent elders). Mounted against a ruddy brown velvet framed 
with a gilt wood reverse moulding.
Bought at the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf ), The Royal Arcade, 
28 Old Bond Street, London W1, for Â£850 in July 1962 (receipt 
dated 14 July, registered without a date but between 21 July and 6 
August) with the aid of a grant from the Regional Fund administered 
by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Bought by Wengraf at 
Sotheby's, London, 10 May 1962, as lot 92. Framed by the Museum 
in 1962 (Annual Report, p. 27).
The subject was identified at auction, by the dealer selling it, 
and by the Keeper (Ian Robertson) buying it, as the 
Flagellation of Christ, but, as Alastair Laing has pointed out, 
two of the bearded elders appear to be preparing to stone 
the victim, only one figure is about to beat him, there is a 
crowned figure seated behind and presiding over the scene, 
accompanied by a large chorus of elders (also assembled to 
proper left) all of which is unorthodox in a Flagellation. 
Moreover, if Christ is represented by the figure tied to the 
column, he is unusually small in size. It may be that the 
episode represented is a relatively obscure one in the life of a 
martyr. Robertson, publishing the relief in the Annual Report 
(1962: 63), wrote that there was `no evidence to uphold the 
tentative attribution made there either to Antonio Calcagni 
or to Tiberio Verzelli'. He was sure, however, that it was 
Venetian and midsixteenth century in date and added that 
it was `Masterly both in composition and execution' and 
`clearly a modello or trial piece for a panel in relief in a bronze 
door'. There seems no good reason to assign it to the sixteenth 

century and the concavesided frame with cherubim in the 
chamfered corners is more typical of the seventeenth or early 
eighteenth century. It does not look certainly Venetian in 
style. And it could be a modello for a panel in marble or stucco 
on a plinth below a statue, or perhaps for a silver relief on an 
altar. It is not `clearly' for a door. Nor is it `masterly'. It looks 

like a pastiche and its antiquity has been put in doubt by the 
thermoluminescence test carried out on a sample taken by 
Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Research Laboratory for 
Archaeology and the History of Art in April 1974 which 
suggested that it was fired less than 115 years previously (ref. 
81m65).
It has recently been observed by Peter CannonBrookes 
that this is clearly related to one of the marble reliefs of the 
life of St Trifone in the Cathedral of Boka Kotorska (Bocche 
di Cattaro) on the Dalmatian coast. A similar modello for 
another of these reliefs is in the Aartsbisschoppelijk Museum, 
Utrecht. The marble reliefs are by Francesco Ca' Bianca 
(1665-1737) and can be dated 1700-1704. They are very 
much more timid in style than the terracottas which might 
be by another hand. How this is reconciled with the suspicions 
voiced above is not clear.




158. Charity in a landscape
32.7 cms. (height); 40.75 cms. (length); 7 cms. (maximum depth 
of relief)
Terracotta, painted naturalistically. The colours have deteriorated 
and the flesh is now a green grey and the foliage is brown. The clay 

has been slightly hollowed behind the woman. At the base it has 
been thickened and forms a flat surfce, the other edges are irregular 
. 
The paint has flaked off the woman's right shoulder and arm, the 
face of the infant to her right, and the body of the older child to 
her left. `4905' is written on the reverse of the relief in the upper 

corner to proper right.
Bought from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf), The Royal Arcade, 
28 Old Bond Street, London W1, in September 1960 for Â£350 
(the invoice is dated 20 September, the receipt 22 September, but 
the work was registered on 8 August).
Charity is traditionally represented as nursing three eager 
children and not uncommonly expressing milk, as seems to 
be the case here, into the mouth of the oldest and most active 
of them. The nest full of young birds, which is somewhat 
roughly indicated in the crook of the tree to proper right, is 
obviously an appropriate attribute. It is hard to imagine how 
a work like this could have been originally displayed (a frame 
would be impossible). It would seem likely that it was a 
sketch for a larger relief and that the colouring was not 

intended. Parker publishing it in the Annual Report observed 
that it was `suggestive in style of the Genoese school of the 
early Eighteenth Century', adding that `the name of 
Francesco Maria Schiaffino (1691-1765) has been tentatively 
put forward as the author, but, for the present, comparative 
material to support this attribution is not forthcoming'. It 
was, it seems, the dealer who first suggested Schiaffino. A 
note in the Register records a letter from Hugh Honour to 
the Keeper of 11 May 1961 proposing other Genoese 
sculptors of the early eighteenth century, Domenico Parodi 
or Anton Maria Maragliano. There seems no compelling 
reason to associate the relief with the Genoese School, nor 
can it be regarded as certainly Italian.


159. Set of profile medallion 
portrait heads of the Twelve Caesars
5.5 cms. (height of each ivory medallion); 4.3 cms. (width of each 
ivory medallion); 5 cms. (height of each medallion visible within 
its frame); 4 cms. (width of each medallion visible within its frame) 

Ivory, mounted in frames of bronze, firegilt (ormolu), which are 
pinned to a stand of ebonized wood. The eight portraits on the 
front of the stand are linked by the swags of husks, also of bronze, 

firegilt. Many portions of the ormolu mounts have been removed, 
some of them in recent years. The bronze ribbons above Titus have 
a firing crack in the suspension loop and the end of the ribbon to 
proper right is missing. The entire swag of husks connecting the 
medallion of Augustus with that of Tiberius and the ring midway 
between them from which the medallion of Claudius is hung are 
missing. The ivory medallions are chiselled with the names of the 
emperors represented: `DOMIT' (for Domitian); `TITUS'; `G IUL' (for 
Gaius Julius Caesar); `NERO'; `G CAES' (for Gaius Caligula); `AUG' 
(for Augustus); `GALBA'; `TI CLAUD' (for Claudius); `TI CAES' (for 
Tiberius); `M OTHO' (for Otho); `A VITELI' (for Vitellius); `VESPAS' 

(for Vespasian).
The ivories are attached to the stand which forms part of the 
Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet bought at auction in 1949 for the 
Heberden Coin Room (see Nos. 35 and 63).
The mounts consist of shot against a flat band (the band given 
a punched texture), husk swags (similarly textured), and 
suspension ribbons with fluttering ends (a punched texture 
on one side contrasted with a burnished reverse). The design 
is typical of the 1770s and could hardly be earlier than the 
mid1760s. It is reminiscent of the patterns employed, 
especially for stucco interior decoration, by Sir William 
Chambers, James Stuart, and John Carr of York_the last 
two named architects, being employed by the marquess of 
Rockingham to make improvements at Wentworth 
Woodhouse, could indeed have designed the stand to which 
these mounts are applied. The stand, with its tapering square 
legs and avoidance of curves, is of sophisticated design, 

although not of superior workmanship or materials. It serves 
to support and supplement the pietra dura cabinet which was 
converted to serve as a coin cabinet as discussed under No. 35. 
The heads of the Caesars are an obvious enough ornament 
for a coin cabinet: a late eighteenthcentury example with 
exceptionally large bronze plaquettes of the Caesars was with 
an antique dealer in Chipping Norton early in 1989. But it 
is surprising that a keen numismatist such as the marquess of 
Rockingham, for whom the cabinet was presumably made, 
should have tolerated such chronological disorder in the 
arrangement of these medallions on the outside of a piece of 
furniture designed to keep medals and coins in proper 
sequence. The only evidence of thought in the arrangement 
is the priority given to Augustus in the centre of the top row 
below the keyhole. The explanation for this disorder may be 
in an unrecorded restoration of the cabinet, perhaps during 
the last century. Lord Rockingham seems to have owned 
some other furniture of a superior character, similarly 
decorated, for in the sale at Christie's, London, of `Etruscan 
and Greek Vases and Fine English Furniture' from Wentworth 
Woodhouse on 15 July 1948, lot 135 was a `Pair of Adam 
mahogany show cabinets the cornices with upsprung foliage 
and with festoons suspended from ivory medallions carved in 
relief from busts of Roman Emperors and others'.
It may be that the ivories on the coin cabinets were carved 
at the same date as the mounts, but it is much more likely 
that they were purchased at an earlier date and had not 
previously served as mounts. In any case they had to be 
supplemented by two ivories of a different character (Nos. 160 
and 161) and the arrangement looks improvised. Rockingham 
had travelled all over Europe and bought from other collectors 
who had done so, so there is no reason to suppose that the 
ivories are of British origin.
Medallion portraits of the Caesars of the type which are 
imitated from Roman coinage (the source often being 
sixteenthcentury engravings of such coin portraits by 
Marcantonio Raimondi, Hubert Goltzius, or ThÃ©odore de 
Bry) are common in a variety of size and media. Some metal 
plaquettes of the Caesars, many with identical portraits to 
those in the set catalogued here, seem to be Italian and of the 
midsixteenth century: a set of bronzes is in the 
Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (IN. 7689-99, for which 
see Natur und Antike in der Renaissance (Liebieghaus, 
Frankfurt on Main, 1985-6), 345-9, nos. 36-46) and one 
of lead in the municipal collections of Ferrara (see R. Varese, 
Placchette e bronzi nelle Civiche Collezioni (Ferrara and 
Pomposa, 1974-5), 43-6). During the early seventeenth 
century such portraits were very popular in Limoges enamel 
(there are some examples in the Ashmolean Museum, but for 
the complete range see MusÃ©e de la Renaissance, ChÃ¢teau 
d'E~gcouen, CL. 22625-8; CL. 10965-8; CL. 22629-34). 
Probably dating from the end of the seventeenth century are 
some ivory examples in which the head is cut out rather than 
part of an oval ivory medallion_`cut out' furniture mounts 

being popular in this period (see No. 256). The most splendid 
set of this type is that in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, 
Munich, in which the heads are placed against a tortoiseshell 
ground (they are arranged in two frames_R. 1050 and 
R. 1051_and labelled as German of c. 1700). Another set 
of good quality is in the Staatliche Museen, BerlinDahlem, 
and is catalogued as `north German?' by C.Theuerkauff (Die 
Bildwerke in Elfenbein des 16.-19. Jahrhunderts (Berlin, 
1986), 307-13 nos. 96-107). A very similar set, but of lower 
quality, mounted on a single tray, was with the Mount Street 
Galleries, 125 Mount Street, London, in June 1986. In this 
case there were ivory labels with the names of the emperors 
spelled in a way that suggests an Italian origin.
Ivory medallions of the type catalogued here are generally 
regarded as dating from the mideighteenth century or later. 
A set differing only in trifling details (such as the movement 
of the ribbon behind the neck of Vespasian), mounted in two 
ebonized frames, was lot 118 on 30 June 1987 at Phillips, 
London. Another set in a private collection, also very similar, 
is mounted as a book, in exactly the manner employed for 
gesso impressions of the same subjects, with an Italian text. 
A distinctive feature of all these medallions is that the emperors 
are now all represented with their profiles facing to the right 
whereas in the earlier cutout ivories, as in the bronze and 
lead plaquettes, half the profiles face the other way.


160 and 161. Profile medallion 
portrait busts of Hadrian and 
`Sabina'
7.7 cms. (height of each medallion visible within its frame); 
5.9 cms. (width of each medallion visible within its frame); 9 cms. 
(height of each beaded frame); 14.7 cms. (height of each mount 
including suspension of ribbon); 6 cms. (width of each beaded 
frame)
Ivory, mounted in frames of ivory, firegilt (ormolu) pinned to an 
ebonized stand. There are slight vertical splits on the head and neck 

of Hadrian. The surface of those of Sabina is abraded and slightly 
discoloured. The mounts are cast from an identical mould. The end 
of the ribbon to proper left of the mount of the portrait of Sabina 
has been broken off and is missing.
The ivories are attached to the stand which forms part of the 
Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet bought at auction in 1949 for the 
Heberden Coin Room (see Nos. 35, 63, 159).
The ivories are clearly by a different artist from the other ivory 
medallions of the Caesars on the same cabinet (No. 159). 
These are larger, more elegant, doubtless based on idealized 
bust sculpture rather than on the conventions of numismatic 
portraiture. That their prototypes are exactly adhered to is 
suggested by the disparity in the cutting of the chest. This 
might also suggest that they in fact came from different sets, 
but the style of carving is very similar. Their incorporation 
into the coin cabinet strongly suggests that the ornamentation 

of the cabinet was improvised out of a miscellany of existing 
ivories in Lord Rockingham's collection. Had he ordered a 
set of ivories for this purpose he would have included other 
emperors and other profiles facing left, would have had all the 
medallions of a standard size, and would not have included 
only one emperor from a later dynasty. Moreover the tightness 
of the frame around the chest of Hadrian and around the 
head and chest of Sabina suggests that the medallions have 
been adapted for these mounts. The portrait of Hadrian's 
consort, Sabina, does not correspond with any recorded in 
such standard sources of the period as the Iconographie 
romaine by A. Mongez, (Paris, 1826), and it may have been 
mistaken for Sabina or intended to pass for her. The other 
bust is certainly a portrait of Hadrian.


162. Standing bull
33.4 cms. (height); 40.6 cms. (length); 2.6 cms. (height of marble 
slab); 40.6 cms. (length of marble slab); 17.9 cms. (width of 
marble slab); 5 cms. (height of wooden plinth); 47 cms. (length 
of wooden plinth); 24 cms. (width of wooden plinth)
Bronze with a dark brown to golden brown patina. Hollow, 
presumably lostwax, cast. The tail has been cast separately and 
riveted. The metal has been scratched to suggest hair. The bronze 
is mounted on a slab of Siena yellow marble with an ebonized 
wooden plinth.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 443 in his catalogues. 
`Bought of Maggi of Genoa with others 1848 Â£30' according to 
the preliminary and the notebook catalogues_the other bronzes 
which he obtained from this source in 1848 are the Jupiter (No. 
337), the Centaur with Cupid (No. 164), and the famous Listening 
Pan formerly attributed to Riccio. Long in reserve, the bronze was 
placed on display in the Fortnum Gallery in 1985.
The bronze Bull is not dissimilar in character to a smaller 
one with its right foot raised which was cast in large numbers 
by the workshop of Giambologna, and this explains the 
relatively early date often given to it. The version in the 
Liebieghaus, Frankfurt (no. 1339), is described on an old 
label as `Italian, sixteenthcentury', which was the opinion 
published by H. Weihrauch, Europa~8ische Bronzestatuetten 
(Brunswick, 1967), 379. The version in the Wallace 
Collection (in the Hertford House Collection by 1834) was 
catalogued by J. G. Mann as Italian and of the seventeenth 
or eighteenth century (Wallace Collection Catalogues: 
Sculpture (1931), with supplement of 1981, S143, p. 52). 
Fortnum seems at first to have regarded his version as by `an 
able caster probably French and of the period of Louis XIV' 
but he amended his entry in his notebook catalogue inserting 
`Italian' after the `probably' and a `perhaps' before the 
`French' and changing the `XIV' to `XV or XVI'.
The prototype, as Fortnum knew, was the much restored 
antique Bull carved out of a finegrained speckled grey marble 
in the Sala degli Animali of the Museo PioClementino in the 
Vatican. This is now known to have been excavated between 

1775 and 1780 at Ostia and so the bronze versions cannot 
date from before then (W. Amelung, Die Skulpturen des 
Vaticanischen Museums (Berlin, 1908), ii. 340, no. 131,
pl. 33; C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichita~6 sotto il 
pontificato di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 113). The earliest 
reference to it in literature seems to be Massi's Indicazione 
antiquaria of 1792 (41, no. 14) and it is unlikely to have 
been reproduced before then. The bronzes are more or less 
exactly the same size as the marble and differ only in that they 
dispense with the tree trunk support under the animal's belly. 
It is worth noting that the Vatican Bull may be the one listed 
by Zoffoli (see Nos. 110-11) in his printed Serie di figure 
available in bronze from his Roman showroom in the 1790s, 
as the Toretto, the little bull, next on the list to, and perhaps 
intended as a companion for, an Ã©corchÃ© Tiger (Notomia di 
tigre). But he offered his bronzes of this subject for sale at 
10 zecchini and they must at this price have been smaller than 
the Ashmolean's version. Toretto could also describe a bull 
of the Giambologna type. Too much significance should not 
be attached to the provenance of Fortnum's piece, but the 
fact that this is after a relatively obscure sculpture in the 
Vatican does make Rome the most probable place of origin. 
It was copied in Portuguese earthenware later in the 
nineteenth century at the Mafra factory at Caldas da Rainha 
(see J. Poole, Plagiarism Personified (Fitzwilliam Museum, 
Cambridge, 1986), 32, no. D12).
For the bronze Lion commissioned by Fortnum as a 
companion to this Bull see No. 87.

163. Medallion profile head of a 
hero or ruler
37.5 cms. (height including base); 33.4 cms. (diameter of marble 
relief)
Carrara marble, discoloured by dirt. Chipped at the rim at lower 
proper right. The relief is circular and has been set in a Portland 
stone base.
Transferred from the Department of Antiquities in 1986. 
Bequeathed by Dr Richard Rawlinson. For the provenance see No. 
151. The stone support seems not to have been in place in 1763 
when the relief was published in R. Chandler, Marmora Oxoniensia 
(Oxford, 1763), i, pl. XLV, no. CVIII.
Adolf Michaelis in his late nineteenthcentury catalogue of the 
antique sculpture in Oxford (Ancient Marbles in Great 
Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 591, no. 223) observed merely 
that this relief is `new', by which he meant not ancient as had 
been assumed by Chandler in the eighteenth century
(op. cit.). It is likely to be Italian and probably dates from the 
early eighteenth century. It may be imitated from the head 
of a ruler on a Hellenistic coin.


164. Centaur ridden by Cupid
40.5 cms. (height of centaur); 17.6 cms. (height of Cupid); 3.6 
cms. (height of green marble plinth); 27.2 cms. (length of this 

plinth); 16 cms. (width of this plinth 9.4 cms. (height of marble 
subplinth); 30.8 cms. (length of this plinth); 19.9 cms. (width 
of same)
The centaur is of bronze with a dark brown to black varnish worn 
in parts to expose a chestnut patina. Hollow, presumably lostwax, 
cast. The Cupid is of silver, also hollow cast, with separate, solid 

cast, wings soldered to his body. The silver has tarnished to a dull 

pale brown and grey. The wrists of the centaur are attached to the 
Cupid with a miniature silver chain. The centaur seems to have 
been cast in two parts: an irregular join is visible just below the 
waist. The supporting rock below one foot has been separately cast. 
The centaur is mounted on a plinth of very dark green marble (said 
by Fortnum to be `the richest quality verdantique') to the short 
faces of which an ormolu swag of flowers is attached and to the long 

faces strips of ormolu, that at the front with raised letters against 
a 
textured field reading: `COME'L CENTAURO, AMOR., DEH ANNODA IL 
TEMPO!' and that on the back engraved with cursive letters `Gioanni 
da Bologna . Fece il Centauro. Gioanni Dughe~6 fece l'amore'. This 
plinth rests on a subplinth consisting of a slab of streaky dove gre 
y 
marble (probably from Carrara) supporting a slab of white Carrara 
marble each side of which is decorated in very low relief `with a 
guilloche of leafy sprays which intertwine between inlaid coloured 
agates etc.' (Fortnum)_each of these stones is oval; among them 
are pieces of antique imperial porphyry, cornelians, and antique 
onyx. There are small chips and scratches, especially to the edges 
of the plinth.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 440 in his catalogues. 
Bought by Fortnum from Maggi of Genoa in 1848 for Â£25 
according to the notebook and the preliminary catalogues (no date, 
provenance, or price is given in the large manuscript catalogue). 
On display in the Coin Room lobby since 1956.
The group was catalogued by Fortnum as `after one of the 
Centaurs of the Capitolone Museum found in Hadrian's Villa 
at Tivoli'. These black marble Centaurs (missing their riders) 
were excavated in 1736 and placed in the Museum by 1765 
(see F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London 
and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 178-9). It is, however, 
possible that the antique prototype for the Ashmolean group 
was the white marble Centaur which was by the early 
seventeenth century in the Borghese Collection but has, since 
the early nineteenth century, been in the Louvre (ibid. 179), 
although the silver Cupid is different in attitude from the 
muchrestored figure on the back of that version. In details 
this small centaur does not correspond exactly with either the 
Borghese or the Capitoline examples: the sexual organ has 
been omitted as have the veins on the belly. More generally 
there is much less sinew and muscle in the body and much 
less pathos in the face. Bronze reproductions of the Capitoline 
versions signed by Righetti in the late eighteenth century and 

the bronze reproduction of the Borghese version in the 
collection of Sir Brinsley Ford are not only more exact but 
far more lively than this.
The attribution of the centaur to Giambologna (`Gioanni 
Bologna') need not be taken seriously, although Fortnum 
presumably did date the work to the late sixteenth century 
for this reason. The attribution of the Cupid to `Gioanni 
Dughe~6', presumably Jean Dughet, Poussin's brotherinlaw, 
is far more peculiar and merits explanation if not respect. It 
prompted Bell to give the group a seventeenthcentury date. 
The insipid modelling and neat but prissy finish of the centaur 
would surely be less surprising in the eighteenth century than 
in the seventeenth_it would be still less unusual in the early 
nineteenth century. The Cupid is quite different in style as 
the double attribution acknowledges. It is typical of the 
blandly smiling and flabbily gracious version of the baroque 
style much beloved by Italian goldsmiths from the late 
seventeenth century onwards and still evident in ecclesiastical 
altar fittings of a traditional kind made today. The pose of 
the Cupid is not well suited to the mount and he relates 
uncomfortably to the centaur's tail.
The subplinth looks as if it cannot be much earlier in date 
than 1848 when Fortnum acquired the group and the green 
marble plinth, if older, may not be much earlier in date. The 
manner in which the centaur is bolted to the plinth at three 
points does not look as if it is original. A rock has been added 
to the centaur's back left hoof and the back right hoof has 
an extension enabling it to make proper contact with the 
plinth. There is a crack in the marble where the latter has 
been bolted. Bell in his marginal annotation to Fortnum's 
large catalogue observes that `the Motto on the plinth may 
perhaps indicate that with its present setting the group was at 
one time intended to decorate a clock'.


165. Terminal head of a maenad
17.5 cms. (height including plinth); 2 cms. (height of plinth)
Giallo antico (yellow marble from Roman Numidian quarries). There 
is an old crack across the neck and the hair falling down beside it 
to proper right. There are losses along the front edge of the chest 
and on the nose which have been made up with plaster tinted to 
match the marble (but in the case of the nose now scratched in parts 

to reveal the white of the plaster). The leaves and berries below the 

ear to proper left have been broken and repaired. There are chips 
missing from many of the leaves. Mounted on a plinth consisting 
of a block of pale Siena marble with a paper label pasted to the fron 
t 
face with `OLDFIELD COLL.' typed on it and `62' written in ink.
Transferred in August 1986 from the Department of Antiquities. 
Bequeathed by Edmund Oldfield FSA in 1902. No. 3 in the section 
`Marble' of the list given in a letter from Oldfield's solicitors on 
16 

May_where described as `a small mask of youthful faun'. No. 62 in 
the `Catalogue of Works presented and bequeathed by Edmund 
Oldfield' which is compiled out of Oldfield's own manuscripts, 
where described as `terminal bust of a Maenad'. Additional notes, 
apparently by Arthur Evans, record that Oldfield bought the head 
at the Purnell Sale at Sotheby's in April 1872. For Oldfield see also 

No. 56.
Miniature antique Roman heads of this sort do survive and 
there seems to have been no suspicion when this item was 
received in the Department of Antiquities that it was not 
ancient. However, the suspicions when they did arise were 
justified. There was a vogue for such works, often carved out 
of scraps of antique marble and copying famous heads in the 
great Roman museums, in the late eighteenth century. Charles 
Heathcote Tatham acting as agent in Rome for the architect 
Henry Holland included drawings of ten such among 
numerous miniature obelisks, urns, and baths in coloured 
marble on a sheet captioned `Various modern ornaments for 
Chimney Pieces &c. (chiefly worked in antique marbles of 
the rarest kind, & others found in excavations made at Rome) 
collected there for Henry Holland Esq. Architect in the years 
1795 & 1796' (Album of Sketches, private collection). One 
of these heads is very similar to this term except that it is cut 
at the neck and mounted on a columnar pedestal. For other 
heads of this sort see Nos. 166-8.


166. Terminal head of Jupiter
12.5 cms. (height)
Giallo antico (yellow marble from Roman Numidian quarries). The 
marble has a pink band and white vein. A small chip is missing from 
the front edges of the chest. ` / S.33' is painted in black on the 
rear of the term and below this `3182' is written in pencil.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S. 33 in his catalogues. 
Employed by him as a chimneypiece ornament at the Hill House, 
Stanmore, together with three similar pieces (see Nos. 167, 168, 
and 169). `Bought for Â£310s at the Sale of the Debruge Coll.' 
[that is the DebrugeDumÃ©nil Collection of objets d'art _for which 

see No. 292] in Paris, 23-31 January, 1-11 February and 12 March 
1850, lot 134 (449, no. 134, in Jules Labarte's catalogue of
1847)_`marbre jaune antique te~7te de Jupiter d'apre~6s l'antique 13 

centimetres'. In his preliminary catalogue (p. 7) Fortnum noted that 

this head had a pedestal of rosso antico.
For heads of this sort see No. 165. Fortnum catalogued this 
correctly as `a reduced copy, probably from the antique. 
Italian 18th or early 19th century'. The work copied is the 
head of the Verospi Jove in the Museo PioClementino of the 
Vatican.



167. Terminal head of Silenus
12.55 cms. (height including brass base)
White, presumably Carrara, marble, now brown with ingrained dust. 
It has been broken across the beard and the lower part of the head: 
the adhesive employed to fix it has darkened and the line of the join 

although fine is therefore visible. The bust is mounted in a tray bas 
e 
of brass with a machined torus moulding. ` / S.3' is painted in 
black on the rear of the term. There are a small oval paper label and 

a small lozengeshaped paper label with a blue border both marked 
`52' on the underside of the base.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in January 1888 and given later in the 
same year. S. 3 in his catalogues. Employed by him as a chimney
piece ornament at the Hill House, Stanmore, together with three 
similar pieces (see Nos. 166, 168, and 169). Bought at the sale of 
the DebrugeDumÃ©nil Collection of objets d'art (for which see No. 
292) in Paris, 23-31 January, 1-11 February, and 12 March 1850, 
lot 136 (no. 136 in Jules Labarte's catalogue of 1847)_`marbre 
blanc. Buste de Sile~6ne couronnÃ© de pampres 14 cents.' It cost 
Fortnum Â£3 10s. according to his notebook catalogue.
For heads of this sort see No. 165. This example is probably 
a companion piece for No. 168. The brass base has been lost 
from the latter and the use of the drill is more conspicuous 
in it. Fortnum believed it to be an ancient Roman piece 
broken from a sacrophagus relief and `worked up' as a bust.


168. Terminal head of Jupiter 
Ammon
11.5 cms. (height)
White, presumably Carrara, marble, now brown with ingrained dust. 
It has been broken at the top of the neck and refixed. The proper 
left horn has been broken and most of it is lost. There are extensive 

traces of darkened adhesive on the stump of the horn. ` / S.4' is 
painted in black on the rear of the term.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in January 1888 and given later in the 
same year. S. 4 in his catalogues. Employed by him as a chimney
piece ornament at the Hill House, Stanmore, together with three 
similar pieces (see Nos. 166, 167, and 169). Bought from the sale 
of the DebrugeDumÃ©nil Collection of objets d'art (for which see 
No. 292) in Paris, 23-31 January, 1-11 February, and 12 March 
1850, lot 135 (no. 135 in Jules Labarte's catalogue raisonnÃ© of 
1847)_`marbre blanc. Buste de Satyr. 12 centimetres'. It cost 
Fortnum Â£3 10s. according to his notebook catalogue.
For heads of this sort see No. 165. This example is probably 
a companion piece for No. 167. Fortnum believed it to be 
of Pan and thought it was broken from the same relief.


169. Mask of Pan or Silenus
17 cms. (height)

Giallo antico (yellow marble from Roman Numidian quarries), 
considerably abraded, also bleached, probably from exposure to the 
elements. The eye sockets are hollow as if designed for eyes of 
different coloured stone or paste. A portion has been broken off by 
the proper left ear and from the end of the central ringlet of the 
beard. The back of the mask is flat with holes filled with plaster of 

Paris in which large nails have been set. There is also a large patch 

of old glue on the flat back. `S. / 2. / .' is painted in black there 
.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in January 1888 and given later in the 
same year. `S. 2' in his catalogues. Employed by him as a chimney
piece ornament at the Hill House, Stanmore, together with three 
similar pieces (see Nos. 166, 167, and 168). `from near Athens' 
according to both the large and the notebook catalogues. Acquired 
before 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is included 
(p. 1, no. 2), was compiled.
Although catalogued and displayed together with heads which 
he knew to be modern miniature chimneypiece copies 
Fortnum regarded this as belonging to a different category_
`Greek. from near Athens. A boldly chiselled work full of 
artistic power. Probably the head of a terminal ornament.' In 
the notebook catalogue he speculated that the eye cavities 
would have been filled with coloured stone and after `Greek' 
added `or GrecoRoman'. Given the material it would have 
to date from after the Roman conquest of Greece, but it 
certainly does look ancient at first sight. It has, however, been 
confidently abandoned by the Department of Antiquities.


170. Four terminal busts of a 
bearded hero or deity attached to a 
bookcase
17.4 cms. (height of each); 9.2 cms. (length of each); 9 cms. 
(width of each)
Bronze with a dark brown varnish worn in several parts to a dark 
olive green natural patina. Hollow, lostwax, cast, precisely chisell 
ed.
The busts are attached to, and were certainly made for, a bookcase 
illustrated in the photographs of C. D. E. Fortnum's house at 
Stanmore, probably dated from the later 1870s, but included in the 
album dated 1873. The bookcase was not included by him in any of 
his catalogues. It has long occupied the office of the Keeper of the 

Department of Antiquities, but whether it arrived in the Museum 
soon after Fortnum's death in 1899 or at a later date (for example 
through Arthur Evans) is not recorded. See below for more on the 
provenance.
The busts crown the pilasters which frame the three openings 
in the lower, plinth, stage of a severe but magnificent 
mahogany bookcase. Between each pilaster are glazed doors 
(double in the centre) and above these is a frieze containing 
drawers embellished, above each bust, with four gilt bronze 

or copper monograms of M and L interlaced below a royal 
crown. The frieze supports a shelf of somewhat grey porto 
venere (gold vein) marble from Genoa, above which rises the 
tall, narrower, rectangular upper stage of the case which is 
decorated, in the strips between the glazed doors, with an 
applied beading of darkly patinated bronze. This latter feature 
together with the pattern of the glazing bars, is typical of 
Tuscan neoclassicism. The numbers a, b, and c marked on 
ivory discs above the doors of the upper stage suggest that 
the case comes from a larger suite. Bookcases of a very similar 
character also with the same crowned monogram and similar 
bronze busts attached to the pilasters are to be found in the 
Palazzo Pitti: these are recorded as coming from Lucca at 
the very end of 1850, and Alvar Gonza~5lezPalacios has pointed 
out (cataloguing a comparable piece in The Adjectives of 
History (Colnaghi, June-July 1983), 34) that the monogram 
is that of Maria Luisa di Borbone (1782-1823), daughter of 
King Charles IV of Spain, who ruled the duchy of Lucca from 
1817 until her death. The Ashmolean's bookcase must belong 
to this period: the crown is explained by Maria Luisa 
continuing to style herself queen (she had been very briefly 
queen of the newly created state of Etruria). Gonza~5lezPalacios 
notes that many talented cabinet makers, among them the 
Frenchman J. B. Youf, were active in Lucca in the early 
nineteenth century.
Queen Maria Luisa's furniture was retained in Lucca by 
her son Carlo Ludovico and his wife Maria Teresa of Savoy 
(daughter of Victor Emmanuel I) until 1847, when they 
became rulers of Parma (which had been Luisa's husband's 
duchy but had been granted at the Congress of Vienna to 
Marie Louise of Austria during her lifetime). After 1847 the 
furnishings of their palace in Lucca were dispersed, some 
remaining in Lucca, others being taken to Parma, and some 
(such as the bookcases already mentioned) being removed to 
Florence as the property of the grand duke of Tuscany to 
whom the duchy of Lucca now belonged. This was the very 
period at which Fortnum was starting to collect works of art 
in Italy and it is likely that he acquired the bookcase around 
1850 and probably in Florence or Genoa. Alternatively he 
might have acquired it in Florence in 1875 when he seems to 
have bought many other items of furniture (e.g. Nos. 206, 
209, 214, 215) for the refurbishment of Stanmore, but by 
that date he seems to have catalogued scrupulously his every 
acquisition, whereas in 1850 he probably did not regard even 
furniture of this kind as worth recording as part of his 
collection.
The bronze busts with their impassive expressions, the 
flattened front plane of the foreheads, the distinct curls of 
hair and beard, symmetrically disposed, must be modelled on 
a Roman marble copy of an archaic Greek bronze. The 
severity of style was more easily accepted in ornamental and 
architectural sculpture than in gallery statues in Napoleonic 
(and postNapoleonic) Italy, as in Hadrianic Rome.


171. Fortitude
107.2 cms. (height from the upper surface of the integral base 
which is sunk in the top of the wooden pedestal); 102 cms. 
(height of pedestal); 48.5 cms. (diameter of base of pedestal)
Terracotta of a pale orange beige colour. Hollow and possibly cast. 
The upper part of the helmet is detachable and seems to have been 
fired separately. There is a break passing through the column and 
the figure's thighs. A large chip is missing from the lower part of t 
he 
column shaft. Traces of gilding remain on the sandals, the column 
plinth, the girdle, and the cresting of the helmet. White paint, or 
at least a thin undercoat of gesso, remains in many of the hollows_
its partial survival making the plaster repairs to the break already 

mentioned less conspicuous. The figure was mounted on a modern 
oak pedestal now employed for No. 78.
Ian Robertson wrote to Paul Wengraf of the Arcade Gallery (The 
Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, London W1) on 3 April 1963 
that `Although brought to the brink of bankruptcy by my so doing, 
I have decided to keep the terracotta figure, and accordingly enclose 

my cheque for Â£150.' The money had been found in the France 
Bequest Fund. The sculpture was evidently already in the Museum 
by April: it was registered on 21 June.
`The figure, originally polychromed and bearing traces of 
gilding, is emblematic of the city of Bologna', according to 
Ian Robertson publishing it in the Annual Report (1963), 
52-3. There seems, however, no reason to suppose that it is 
anything more than a personification of Fortitude with the 
not unusual attributes of helmet, column, and club of 
Hercules. Robertson also wrote that it `can be surely assigned 
to an artist of the Bolognese school, possibly a member of 
the Gandolfi family of sculptors.' For the sculptural activity 
of the Gandolfi see No. 37. This figure is not similar to any 
others that may reasonably be attributed to them. The pose 
is taken from a type of crosslegged antique Muse Polyhymnia 
known in a number of surviving marble versions which Canova 
so effectively imitated in his Terpsichore (completed in 1811). 
The gravity of demeanour, the lack of all flutter in the drapery, 
and the stationary and compact monumentality suggest a 
date in the first half of the nineteenth century. The figure no 
doubt comes from a series of Virtues, perhaps adorning the 
niches of a neoclassical palace, coloured white and gold to 
accord with the surrounding dÃ©cor. It was not uncommon 
for terracotta to be used in this way and a number of figures 
supposed to be of stucco have turned out to be of terracotta 
coated with gesso. A large terracotta statue of Ospitalita~6 in a 
private collection in Rome attributed by Federico Zeri to 
Camillo Pacetti (1758-1826), published in Sculture del xv al 
xix secolo della collezione di Federico Zeri (Milan, Museo Poldi 
Pezzoli, and Bergamo, Accademia Carrara, 1989) 66, is in 
very similar taste, as are smaller terracotta figures in Zeri's 
collection.
A sample was taken by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the 

Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History 
of Art in October 1986 and thermoluminescence tests 
suggested that it had been fired between 1736 and 1836 (ref. 
381y29).


172. Profile head of a warrior
17.2 cms. (height from chin to forehead); 33.1 cms. (width)
Terracotta of a beige colour, partially covered with paint, now 
discoloured and flaking. The paint still covering much of the helmet 

is a dark grey. That on the face is a paler grey. There are traces of 

gilding on the crest of the helmet. The thickness of the relief varie 
s 
between 3 and 5 cms. The relief is only a fragment but the edge 
behind the head and the corner behind the cresting of the helmet 
appear to be original.
No provenance is recorded.
The Greek profile and parted lips and rich flowing locks 
suggest the idealized portraits of Alexander the Great. The 
relief is probably Italian. It could date from the sixteenth, or 
the seventeenth, century but it more likely to have been made 
in the eighteenth or nineteenth, given the sympathy for, and 
knowledge of, Greek, as distinct from Roman, art which it 
reveals.


173. Ganymede with the Eagle
220.1 cms. (height, including integral marble base); 74.5 cms. 
(length, across the wings); 45.3 cms. (length of base); 29.2 cms. 
(width of base)
White Carrara marble. There are grey patches in the marble below 
the youth's right knee and at the back of the eagle's head and a 
rusty vein across the youth's chest. There are repairs to the dog's 
nose and its left ear (the latter is now loose). There are chips miss 
ing 
from the eagle's left wing at the tip and from behind the other wing. 

The subbase is carved from a separate block of marble and so is the 

portion of the base to proper left together with the dog seated on 
it. The eagle's left wing is separately carved and added: the join is 

now loose. The drapery blown around in front of the youth's genitals 

is also separately carved, and presumably an addition which was not 
originally planned. Cleaned by Miss Western of the Department of 
Antiquities early in 1964. Mounted on a painted wooden pedestal. 
What must be the group's Victorian pedestal survives in the basement 

store: it is of Siena (flecked mustard yellow) marble of rectangular 

plan with canted sides and an arched front panel.

Given in 1937 by Mr Henry Donner (Annual Report (1937), 34). 
Placed on loan to the Cecil Jackson Room in the Sheldonian Theatre 
basement in March 1964. Retrieved and placed on the sill of the 
central window of the staircase to the Upper Galleries of the 
Department of Western Art in August 1989.
The only record of this sculpture seems to be the entry in the 
Annual Report for 1937 (p. 34) recording it as a work by 
Thorvaldsen given by Mr Henry Donner. It is not by 
Thorvaldsen, but by an Italian, or at least by a sculptor 
working in Italy, at the same period. The insipid sentiment, 
boneless grace, and considerable technical virtuosity are 
typical of sculptors such as Tadolini in Rome or of Giovanni
Maria Benzoni in Milan in the two decades following 
Canova's death. The cutting of the marble is in many passages 
very fine (for instance in the eagle's feathers, and the bark of 
the trunk), in the manner associated with skilled Italian 
craftsmen, but some of the drapery is routine and that which 
falls down beside the trunk is obviously designed to provide 
another vertical support. The bridge of marble between the 
index finger of the youth's left hand and his thigh was 
presumably intended to be removed after safe transport from 
the sculptor's studio. The support behind his left heel could 
however not be dispensed with prudently.


174. Head of a bishop saint
41.5 cms. (height); 50 cms. (length from top of mitre to chest)
Terracotta, pinky orange to beige in colour. The mitre is open at 
the top and the head has been clawed hollow from above. The cope 
has been modelled out of a separate piece of clay and this has been 
reinforced with clay from below to form a solid base. A hole has 
been pushed through this base to join the hollow in the head. There 
are firing cracks in the neck to proper right and, less conspicuously 
, 
across the beard. There are chips at the rim of the cope to proper 
right and there is a patch of plaster of Paris in the rim to proper 
left.
Bought for Â£1,200 from the Arcade Gallery (Paul Wengraf), The 
Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, London W1, in December 1966 
out of the George Flood France Fund with a contribution from the 
Regional Fund administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum. 
The work was probably reserved in October. It was registered on
9 December.
Ian Robertson wrote to Hugh Wakefield of the Victoria and 
Albert Museum soliciting support for the purchase of this 
terracotta on 25 October 1966, praising the `subtlety and 
distinction' of the modelling which he regarded as 
`comparable with the quality of a painting by the elder 
Tiepolo'. Publishing it in the Annual Report for 1966
(p. 47) he considered it as the `most noteworthy' of the five 
pieces of sculpture acquired in that year. In this case his 
enthusiasm was, it seems, supported by experts in the
field. A letter from Charles Avery of the Department of
Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum to Ian Lowe on 

8 December indicates that the idea that the terracotta was an 
eighteenthcentury Venetian work came from the Keeper of 
his Department, John PopeHennessy. Avery proposed 
Giovanni Bonazza (1654-1736) as the artist and cited his 
figure of St Zeno completed in 1708 for the altar of St Antonio 
in the duomo at Montagnana (C. Semenzato, `Giovanni 
Bonazza', Saggi e memorie, 2 (1959), 293, fig. 9), but also 
pointed to Giuseppe Bernardi (`Il Torretto') as a possibility. 
Robertson had already mentioned Bonazza in his letter to 
Wakefield in October and the terracotta had been registered 
as probably by him.
It is true that a similar type of bearded saint is found
in works by Bonazza and Bernardi (see, for the latter,
C. Semenzato, `Giuseppe Bernardi detto il Torretto', Arte 
veneta, 12 (1958), 177, pl. 196), but the style of sketchy 
modelling with its deliberately smudged treatment of the 
features, the pupil of the bishop's right eye being almost 
indistinguishable, the beard expiring amid the lightly scribbled 
ornament of the cope, the opening of the lips left as a torn 
line, suggests a sculptor influenced by the sfumato of such 
late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury sculptors as 
Rodin, or, still more, Medardo Rosso. The introspective, even 
ghostly mood seems modern and so does the whole shape of 
the bust which is designed to give an apparitional, floating, 
character impossible to relate to a socle. (On arrival in the 
Museum the head was supported on an ebonized wooden 
stand from which it was emancipated on 4 January 1967 by 
Mohammed Saleh, during which operation a nut and a bolt, 
seven inches long, were removed from the back_as recorded 
in a note by Hugh Macandrew in the Register.)
Doubts concerning the antiquity of the terracotta are 
reinforced by the thermoluminescence dating of samples 
taken from the head in April 1974 and October 1986 by Mrs 
Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford University Research 
Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art which 
indicated that the piece was fired less than 150 years ago (ref. 
81m62 and 381y33). The probability of the work being 
modern does not make it a forgery. It might be a historical 
portrait in much the same spirit as Gemito's Charles V (No. 
38), and, considered as such, it certainly possesses genuine 
merit.
