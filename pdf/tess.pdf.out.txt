I. INTRODUCTION

The middle decades and the second half of the fifth century BC saw the rise of the Greek settlement
at Pichvnari [fig. 1], which became a significant zone of contact between Colchians and Greeks (Vickers,
Kakhidze 2004: 166; Kakhidze 2007: 225-227), There are not many sites in the Black Sea area where natives
and colonists co-existed so closely, and few cemeteries are comparable for the wealth of the grave goods.

The later Greek necropolis of Pichvnari, which was in use between the early fourth century and
c. 330 BC, was rich, and in many respects contmued the traditions of the earlier necropolis.

In all 136 graves in the later cemetery have been studied since 1967 (Kakhidze 1974b; 1979a;
1979c; 2007a: 1143-1178; Vickers, Kakhidze 1998; 2000; 2002; 2006a; 2006b: 43-44; 2008a: 137-
145; 2008b: 225-232; 2011; Kakhidze, Tavamaishvili, Vickers 2002; Vickers, Kakhidze, Tavamais-
hvili 2005 ; Kakhidze, Kakhidze 2010; 2011). It is important to note that the burials and ritual plat-
forms are well preserved; no graves overlap. This creates ideal conditions for determining burial
types, funerary customs, orientation, deposition patterns, social and ethnic composition, and chronol-
ogy (Vickers, Kakhidze 2004: 192-193). To our knowledge, no other cemetery in the Black Sea arca
is so well preserved. Moreover, Pichvnari is of special interest since it 1s the only site in the eastern
Black Sea area with what are in all likelihood ethnically Greek burials. Individual inhumation burials
predominate. Only a single cremation burial has been attested.

First, though, a brief word on the history of the excavations in the Pichvnari Greek cemetery
of the fourth century BC.

SOVIET PERIOD EXCAVATIONS

The fourth-century BC Greek cemetery [fig. 2] has been an object of interest since 1962, when
some artifacts were collected on the surface (Kakhidze 1963: 52-53). The first three graves and a
ritual platform were identified in 1967 [fig. 3]. The trench ran from south to north (12m x 4m). Hera-
clean amphoras, an amphoriskos and lekythoi with net decoration, local ceramics, beads, and iron,
bronze and silver jewellery were discovered in the graves, and fragments of Attic black-gloss ware,
grey ware vessels, fish-plates, cups and local pottery on the ritual platform (Kakhidze 1974b).

The next year the trench was extended to the SE and eleven burials were discovered [fig. 3].
Heraclean amphoras (some of them stamped), /ekythoi with net decoration, a plain amphoriskos,
bowls, local jugs, badly preserved coins, beads, etc. were found in the graves. The ritual platforms
yielded fragments of black-gloss pottery (the first time that an oinochoe had been discovered in Pich-
vnarl) and a Colchian axe mould (Kakhidze 1974b).

Burial 15 was studied in 1972, when only two squares (20 and 21) were added [fig. 3]. Excavations
were continued in 1976 in an attempt to define the extent of the fourth century BC Greek cemetery and
to find its relation to the fifth century BC Colchian and Greek cemeteries. Several ritual platforms and
twelve burials were studied [figs 4-5], one of which was a cremation burial employing a plain clay vessel
