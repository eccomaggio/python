1 and 2. Flagellators of Christ
23.2 cms (height 0of No. 1, figure with both arms raised);
23.5 cms (height of No. 2, figure with right arm only raised);
5.5 cms (height of plinths)
Bronze with a warm brown natural patina retaining extensive patches of translucent red varnish, now partially blackened, especially in the hollows. Hollow, lost-wax casts. There is a performation in the bronze below the loin cloth worn by No. 1, also a plug beside the ankle of the right foot of this figure. Both figures are very finely tooled withy the hair (including hair in armpits and pubes) sharply but boldly cut. The loin cloth is minutely punched. The figures must originally have held separately fashioned whips.
Both figures are mounted on plinths of oak veneered with brass, fire gilt, and with tortoiseshell, fitted with bronze scroll-feet and lion masks, also fire-gilt. (Some pieces of veneer are loose, broken, or missing especially below the lion heads on the back and side faces of both plinths.) There are circular paper labels belowe the plinths with black borders and 'J. FRANCIS & MARGARET MALLETT' printed, and with '27E' inscribed in ink, in the centre. Both plinths marked 'M 176/1' and 'M176/2' in black paint on the corner of the upper ormolu moulding of the plinth  where chamfered.
Bequeathed by J. F. Mallet, who died 7 January 1947. Received in the Museum during the last week of May 1947. No. 176 (1 and 2) in the inventory of his collection where [sic] valued at £100. No provenance supplied.
Described by Mallett as 'Finely modelled and highly finished. Beautiful brown patina. N. Italian. Attributed to Pietro Tacca.' The pair of figures are in fact cast from models almost certainly made by Algardi. Together with a figure of Christ bound to the column, they formed one of the most popular small sculptural groups (of silver as well as of bronze) in European art. The same model for Christ is employed with flagellators of a different design which may plausibly be attributed to Duquesnoy, who is indced credited by Bellori with the invention of a group of this subject (including Christ). Jennifer Montagu has proposed, convincingly, that the more vigorous of the pairs of flagellators-that represented by the Ashmolean's bronzes-originated in models by Algardi. She dates these models to the second half of the 1630s. Of this particular pair of bronzes she writes: 'The casts appear to be reasonably old, although the Boulle-type bases are no doubt of more recent date' (J. Montagu, Alessandro Algardi (London and New Haven, Conn.,1985), i.19z ii. 315-22, no. 9; and for the Ashmolean bronzes 319, no. 9 C. 19). The bases resemble in both style and materials French work of the late seventeenth century of the kind revived in the second half of the eighteenth century, but they may be of modern manufacture; certainly all screw fittings appear to be modern. The figures, which are of as high quality as any other bronze versions I have seen, seem to be either Italian or French. See also No. 434.",,catalogue text,en

3. Thalia
53.5 cms. (height excluding socle); 13 cms. (height of socle)
Carrara marble. The turned and waisted socle (made of a different piece of marble) has been broken at the base, repaired, and then rebroken. Some chips are missing.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S.37 in his catalogues. Said in the large catalogue and the notebook catalogue to have been acquired from Amici in Rome in 1853; but in the preliminary catalogue of 1857 the date is given as 1851.
This bust of the Muse of Comedy was evidently acquired with that of Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy (No. 20), as a companion, this couple in turn forming a pair for the two copies of antique heads by Gott (Nos. 514, 515). Fortnum noted that it was 'Thalia. Copy from the antique statue in the Vatican'. The statue in question is a seated Muse in the Sala delle Muse in the Museo Pio-Clementino which was discovered, together with the Melpomene and other Muses, at the supposed Villa di Cassio at Tivoli in excavations commenced before 1773 by Domenico de' Angelis, and was obtalned for the papal museum by the intervention of Giovanni-Battista Visconti in 1774 (W. Amelung and G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums, III. i (Berlin, 1935-56), no. 503--erroneously 508 in plates; C. Pietrangeli, Scavi e scoperte di antichità sotto il Pontificato di Pio VI (Rome, 1958), 139-40). The copy is in some respccts an improvement on the original, in which the leaves in the hair are not completely undercut but retain their bridges. Amici had worked in Canova's studio and was one of the leading sculptors in Rome in the decades following Canova's death. He completed the tomb of Pope Gregory XVI in St Peter's in 1854 and would have been busy with this huge work when Fortnuni visited his studio. Such a bust is likely to have been produced under Amici's supervision rather than executed by him in person and was probably a stock item designed for sale to studio visitors rather than specially commissioned. An identical bust is in the Royal Palace in Madrid (numbered 427 in hollow behind chest), also paired with a Melpomene. Another was lot 246 in the sale of Durwards Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, Christie's, 10-11 July 1989.",,catalogue text,en

4. Inkstand in the form of a faun astride a tortoise
22.5 cms. (height); 19.75 cms. (length)
Bronze with dark brown natural patina with traces of black or blackened varnish in the hollows. Thick-walled hollow cast. Cast in two pieces,; the faun and shell together with the shell of the tortoise forming one piece. There is a plug in the faun's right shoulder and a firing crack in the back of the faun's neck and in the top of his left arm. There seems to have been an extra pouring of metal in teh head. Chaplet pins evident in the interior of the bronze (at faun's right shoulder). 'B/--88/[symbol reminiscent of EF]' is painted in white on the interior of the tortois shell together iwht a recent label numbered '112'. The same is painted in the inside of the body of the tortoise with another label numbered '112' below.
Lent by eD.E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the same year. B. 1088 in his catalogues. Presumably acquired after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled.
An inkpot would presumably have been placed in the shell
held in the faun's right hand. Divisions for pen and sand are
found in the body of the tortoise. Classed by Fortnum as 'Florentine?' and dated to 1580 in his notebook catalogue.Having discoveredd that it was in the manner of Bartolommeo Ammanati (1511-92), he corrected the date ot 1560, and toyed with the idea that it might be by Ammanati, but, surely rightly, confined himself to observing that there is an obvious debt to the latter's eight split-legged fauns, some with similar grins and brushe-hack hair, placed in 1575 around the rim of the Fountain of Neptune in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence--works designed probably in 1560 when Ammanati was competing for the commision. Bode, oddly, seems to have ignored this connection and published the inkstand as a Venetian work of around 1575 (Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), i. 74, fig. 90). Pope-Hennessy on the other hand regarded it as 'likely that the inkstand is an autograph small bronze by Ammanati' (Italian Bronze Statuettes (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1961), no.113). J. Draper in his 1980 revised edition of Bode has suggested 'North Italian late Sixteenth Century'.
The surface of the bronze is very dull and the linear pattern of the tortoise shell and skin in particular is blunt and vague. This is also true of the version in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (10.173--in reserve), but less true of that in the Rijksmuseum (J. Leeuwenberg, Beeldhouwkunst in het Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, 1973), 379, no. 638). (Neither of these versions retains the body of the tortoise as a base.) It is surely very unlikely that any of these three bronzes are autograph works by Ammanati. The casting technique (which may not be lost-wax) does not resemble that of any sixteenth-century bronze inkstand I have inspected. It is possible that they were made in the last century when at least one sculptor was an accomplished mimic of Ammanati's style--this was Francesco Pozzi (1779-1844), who, in 1831, executed the right-hand satyr of the south-east face of the fountain--the 'satyr to left of the marine goddess who looks towards the Marzocco' (A. Lensi, Il Palazzo Vecchio (Milan, 1929), 315, citing F. Moisè, Illustrazione storico-artistica del Palazzo de'Priori, oggi Palazzo Vecchio (Florence, 1843), 169 n.)--as a replacement for one of Ammanati's. This large bronze is, however, a superior cast, the equal of its neighbours and far sharper than the inkstands. For a reduction of a part of Ammanati's fountain on a scale comparable with the inkstands see Christie's, New York, I November 1989, lot 53.",,catalogue text,en

5. Victory
39.3 cms. (height from foot to head); 12.2 cms. (length of shaft);
9 cms. (diameter of marble ball)
Bronze with a dull green patina and simulated corroded surface. Hollow cast, filled with core. A red paste gem is inserted in the bracelet on the figure's left upper arm. Cast without right arm of index finger of the figure's left hand and with empty eye sockets (replicating damaged original). The shaft stamped with miniature letters: 'DEANGELISFILS'. Mounted on a ball of Porto venere marble (black marble with gold veins) and a columnar shaft of ebonized wood (the latter not original).
Bequeathed by the Rev. J. W. R. Brocklebank in 1926. No. 30 on Andrew Shirley's receipt of January 1927 ('A verde statuette, Victory, standing on marble sphere & plinth').
This is unusual among the bronzes in Brocklebank's collection in that it is a replica of an antique, but it is nevertheless not unrelated in taste to his other pieces, and in particular his versions of Gilbert's treatment of the same theme (Nos. 502, 503, 512). The firm of De Angelis was founded in 1840 and prospered in the last years of the last century and in the early years of this, specializing in reproductions of the most popular items in the Naples Museum. Larger works produced by them in the first decade of this century are signed 'S. de Angelis & Fils' (see the life-size Athlete at Cartwright Hall, Bradford, dated 1905 and the reduction of the Adorante sold at Sotheby's, London, 11 June 198z lot 239/2, dated 1907). By 1915 the firm had merged with that of Chiurazzi (which had been established in 1870 by J. Chiurazzi) to form the 'Fonderie Artisiche Riunite'. By 1929 the firm was under the management of Frederico and Salvatore Chiurazzi and know as 'Chiurazzi', or, officially, the 'Società Anonima: Fonderie, Cerimca, Marmoria'. Their catalogue of that year noted that the firm was formerly that of 'Chiurazzi and De Angeelis'. In this catalogue the 'Vittoria' appears as no.93, and was available in four sizes of which one was the size of the original (40 cms.--as here, approximately; two of the others were larger) and in three patinas (Pompeian, Herculanean, and Renaissance, the first, which is used here, being closest to the original and also the cheapest, at 1,000 lire for this size, as against 1,250 for the black Herculanean and 1,500 for the brown Renaissance). The Roman bronze reproduced has the inventory number 4997 in the Naples Museum, and the modern number 576. It is regarded as a copy of a Hellenistic original and is not now included in the popular anthologies, although Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue describes it as 'questa mirabile statua . . . rimarchevole per la leggerezza del drappo svolazzante al vento e che delinea la svelte forma del corpo'. As Chiurazzi acknowledged, the marble ball is a modern idea (found in the display of the bronze in the Naples Museum). The figure would originally have been suspended from the ring in its back. The bronze in the Naples Museum is also furnished with a wand in the figure's left hand but the figure would originally have held a palm or trophy. The other arm would, it is supposed, have held a trumpet to broadcast victory. A version of the Victory in the Glasgow Art gallery and Museum (93-28d) was purchased from Sabatino de Angelis et fils on 30 March 1893 for £8. An inferior cast was lot 148, Sotheby's, London 4 July 1991.",,catalogue text,en

6. Heroic head
47.3 cms. (height of socle); 26 cms. (diameter of socle)
Bronze of a dull black to dark green patina simulating corrosion. Hollow, lost wax, cast. The upper portion of the back dented. The iron cramp ataching the bronze to the socle loose.
Provenance unknown.
The simulated diaspro di Sicilia marble employed for the socle is of a type often employed by the firm of De Angelis/Chiurazzi (for which see No.5). The bronze is an accurate replica of a fragment of a statue found in the eighteenth century in the Villa dei Pisoni, Herculaneum i [[??]] Museo Nazionale, Naples, inv. no. 5618, modern number 605). It was long supposed, following a theory of Sogliani, to represent an ideal mingling of the type of Dionysus with the likeness of Plato and was known as the Dionysosplaton. Friedrichs considered it an original by Scopas or Praxiteles, but it is now regarded as a hellenistic modification (or sometimes as a Roman copy of a Hellenistic modification) of an earlier model. (A. and B. Maiuri, Das Nationalmeseum in Neapel (Munich, 1958), 66.) In Chiurazzi's 1929 catalogue this is no.4 [[??]] and priced at 2,400 lire for the original size (given as 50 cms. but the same as this version) in the 'Herculanean patina (black). It cost 3,000 lire with a 'Renaissance' patina (brown), and was not available with a 'Pompeian' patina (green). It could also be purchased 28 and 15 cms high. The turned and waisted socle, unhappy in size and shape, reproduces that upon which the bronze in the Naples Museum is mounted. Other versions of this bronze are furnished with an alabaser base (one was with the dealer Edric Van Vredenburgh, Davies Street, London, in the winter of 1989). One in the Art Gallery and Museum Glasgo (93-28b) was purchased from Sabatino de Angelis et fils on 30 March 1893 for £12.",,catalogue text,en

39.7[[??]] cms (height); 13.7 cms. (height of socle at front); 18.3 cms. (diameter of socle)
Pink-grey terracotta with traces of white plaster especially in cracks and hollows. Hollow but with very thick walls. Apertures are concealed behind the beard to proper left. There are hair-line cracks in many places. A chip is missing on the collar to proper right. A portion of the moustache and proper right eyebrow is made up with wax slightly darker than the terracotta. Finger prints are evident in some areas (e.g. in the beard and ear-lobe to proper left). Mounted, by means of lead reiforced with, and largely concealed by, plaster of Paris, to a turned and waisted socle of verde di Prato (Tuscan serpentine). 'S. 24.[symbol similar to EF ligature]' is painted in black on the back of the collar.
Lent by eD.E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888, given later in the same year. S.24 in his catalogues. Bought by Fortnum from the sculptor and dealer Professor Emilio Sntarelli of Florence in 1870 together with a bust of Lorenzo de' Medici. The socle is shown in Fortnum's photographs  and must have been fixed in Florence. A letter from Santarelli to Fortnum of 19 June 1870 discusses shipping from Livorno (undertaken through the agency of Luigi Stombert). The head had safely arrived on 26 July, followed by Santarelli's certificate, dated 16 August, in which he declared that he had acquired it 'circa venti anni fa'--i.e. in about 1850--from Professore Bibliotecario Ajazzi who had, he understood, long owned it. It was 'formerly in the Laurentian Library whence it had been abstracted many years ago'. In his notebook catalogue Fornum recorded that Santarelli would not for a long while agree to part with this head and the bust of Lorenzo. He paid £40 for the latter: this is likelyh to have cost the same amount.
Emilio Santarelli, who sold this terracotta to Fornum, had acquired ifrom Ajazzi as a protraid of Cellini. Santarell ialso believed it to be by Cellini. Santarelli was one of the leading sculptors in Florence and also a noted connoisseur (for other dealings between him and Fortnum see the Prliminary Essay). His most famous work was the full-le3nght portrait of Michelangelo completed in 1856 for the Arcade of the Uffizi and he was much concerned with the iconogrpahy of famous Florentines of the Renaissance and incurably optimistic about the portraits of them. Fortnum was at least convinced that it was by Celline, although the possibility of it being by Naninelli had occurred to him. It is 'beyond Baccio Bandinelli, & the rest, and by M. angelo [sic] it certainly is not', he wrote in the notebook catlogue. The attribution is defended at greater length in his large catalogue: 'the vigorous expression, the quiver of the lip, and the admirable treatment of the beard are remarkable. I don not know any other sculptor of the period of its unquestionable production with whose manner it so much agrees. It seems to me too good for B. Bandinelli.' The handling he compared with that in Cellinin's bust protrit of Bindo Altoviti (Isabella Steward Gardener Museum, Boston) and the statue of Perseus in the Loggia dei Lanzi--both of them bronzes, and indeed no comparable work in clay by Cellini--or by Bandinelli--seems to have survived. Fortnum noted that Cellini was said to have modelled a bust of Annibale Caro 'to the medals of whom this bears some resemblence'. eF. Bell, however, annotating the large catalogue, noted that this possibility was ruled out by comparison with Dosio's memorial bust of Caro in S. Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. Bell also 'inclined' to think that it was by Bandinelli, to whom it seems first to have been attributed by E. Plon (Benvenuto Cellini, orfèvre, médailleur, sculpteur (Paris,1883), 341). The modern literature on Cellini, most recently the monograph by Pope-Hennessy of 1986, does not discuss the terracotta. Maria Grazia Ciardi Dupré in 1963 published the head as by Rustici ('Giovan Francesco Rustici', Paragone, 14 (1963), 45-6), but without giving compelling reasons. Charles Avery in a letter to Ian Lowe of 9 March 1967 speculated that there might be a connection with a marble bust of Andrea Doria recently acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum and attributed to Montorsoli.
One can see why Fortnum preferred to give this head to Cellini rather than to Bandinelli: he was right to liken it to the bust of Bindo Altoviti (the vigorous treatment of the beard is especially close) and it has the fire of Cellini's bronze portrait of Cosimo and none of the blandness of Bandinelli's marble portrait of the same sitter. On the other hand, the head certainly resembles those in the engraved portraits of Bandinelli and in his own self-portraits (most notably as Nicodemus in the Pietà which marks his own tomb in SS Annunziata in Florence, in the profile relief in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence, and in the painting in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston). There is a still closer relationship with some drawings by Bandinelli of amply bearded, frowning men, usually regarded as somewhat idealized self-portraits, and perhaps intended as such, of which one notable example is in the British Museum (1895-9-15-555), and another was recently with La Sirène, of 14 rue de L'Eschaudé, Paris (no. 41 in their catalogue of Estampes et dessins anciens (1987) I). But both of these have rounded and softer modelling, typical of Bandinelli's drawings in chalk (and his marble reliefs), which is particularly evident in the hair, which flows forward in ornamental curls, whereas in the terracotta it is roughly clawed back and stabbed.
This need not discourage us from an attribution to Bandinelli, however, for whom working in clay may well have been analogous to drawing with a quill or reed, in which medium his work has a similar jagged energy. Furthermore, there is one marble sculpture by Bandinelli which is so similar to this terracotta that the two works must be closely related: the head of the saint in the niche to the left of Pope Leo X in the latter's tomb of 1536-41 in S. Maria sopra Minerva, Rome--a saint intended for St Paul but consistently misidentified (see R. Ward, Baccio Bandinelli (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, May-July 1988), 58-9). If the terracotta is what it seems--a large preparatory sketch for the marble (or even the fragment of a clay sketch for the marble salvaged and baked) then it is a very rare survival, without parallel in the sculpture of its period. The heads are difficult to compare (the marble can only be studied from below) but the differences are slight. In the marble the hair on the crown is more pronounced, the beard neater, the lips more pouted.
A sample was taken from the terracotta by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in March 1987 and thermo-luminescence tests suggested a firing date between 1487 and 1637 (38l-z-88).",,catalogue text,en

9. Cleopatra
29.6 cms. (height of figure, excluding integrally cast tang); 3.4 cms. (height of base)
Bronze with a greeny-brown natural patina and traces of a red-brown varnish, blackened in parts. Hollow, lost-wax, cast. There is a crack at the back of the figure's right heel. Large holes (0.3 cms. diameter) in the proper left buttock and on the back of the proper right thigh and right shoulder, more or less imperfectly 'filled, evidently derive from chaplet pins which have shaken loose. Mounted on a triangular base with three feet with a large threaded hole into which the tang fits (for the base see below).
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the same year. B.412 in his catalogues. 'bt. Florence 1865.'
Fortnum regarded this as 'somewhat coarsely executed but with a distinctive character': the inept chiselling between the legs, the uncleaned junction of forearm and head, the hideous nipples, the botched modelling of the eyes (one smudged and the other crudely stabbed to suggest a pupil) deserve less qualified censure. He considered it as 'probably intended for Eve, the serpent fondling rather than wounding'. Cleopatra seems more likely, for although it is odd for that heroine to be represented completely undressed, the reptile is more the size of an asp than of the large serpent of the Garden of Eden. It also seems more inclined to bite than to whisper. The design of the triangular base with its feet in the form of abortive fat-headed dolphins and its weak frieze of floral arabesque and its execution--the dolphins and the field of the frieze given a punched texture--are typical of the workshop of Severo da Ravenna and no doubt suggested to Fortnum the idea that it was north Italian of the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. Bode, however, recognized that the bronze was a copy of a statuette by Bandinelli (Italian Bronze Statuettes Of the Renaissance (London, 1907-2), ii.18), and perhaps for this reason the base began to look wrong. Bell's pencil annotation to Fortnum's large catalogue reads, 'This misleading addition was removed and replaced by amarble plinth 1929' (old photographs show it mounted on a block of porto venere, gold-veined black marble). By the 1970s, however, it had become possible to identify the products of Severo da Ravenna's workshop and to see that the workshop continued in business under the managementof Severo's son into the second half of the sixteenth century using, for the most part, models dating from about 1500. It was quite able to take over a model from Bandinelli. Consequently Anthony Radcliffe pointed out in a letter of 6 September 1976 to Christopher Lloyd that the triangular base was probably original. The base was found by November 1976 and was restored in March 1977. Examination of the bronze and 'X-rays' made from it for Radcliffe and Richard Stone of the Metropolitan museum, New York, confirmed that the technique of the bronze was entirely consistent with Severo's foundry style.
Other versions of the bronze are recorded. One from the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples, was exhibited in 1961 (Italian Bronze Statuettes (Arts Council, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1961), no. 106). Another is in the Abbott Guggenheim Collection and was exhibited at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (L. Camins, Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes from the Abbott Guggenheim Collection (Sas Francisco, 1988), 20, no. 3). Three casts of the figure, even more coarsely finished and clumsily modelled, with serpents in different positions and the women given idiotic smiles, combine to form the Second lowest set of supporters of supporters of a seven-stage, three-sided, candelabrum (5 1/2 feet high) in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco (61.35), the other elements of which are all found in other standard productions of Severo da Ravenna's workshop (it looks indeed like a compilation designed to cope with a surplus of stock).
The bronze in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, Florence (no. 354), from which these versions derive is of superior finish and larger--32.2 cms. high (including, however, an integral bronze base about 1 cm. high). The subject has always been identified as Cleopatra and is one of a set of six bronzes identified as by Bandinelli since the sixteenth century, two of which (a Venus with a dove and Jason) also bear his name. Of these bronzes, three are larger than the Cleopatra (Jason 39.8 cms., Venus with a dove 37.8 ems., and a Leda 36.1 cms.), but two very close in size to it (a Venus 33.3 cms. and a Leda 31.5 cms.). Three engraved portraits of Bandinelli show him in the company of similar bronze statuettes, and one of these, showing him surrounded by students drawing them by candlelight, is inscribed by the engraver, Agostino Veneziano, as depicting Bandinelli's 'academia' in the 'luogo detto Belvedere' in 1531. According to Vasari's life (Opere, ed. G. Milanesi (Florence,1906), vi. 153), it was when he was working in the Vatican Belvedere that Bandinelli first made bronze statuettes. This was after 1529 when he had accompanied Pope Clcmcnt VII from Bologna to Rome and was making plans for the adornment of Castel Sant'Angelo. 'To pass the time and to experiment with casting technology he made numerous statuettes alte due terzi e tonde [""height two-thirds of a braccio and in the round""--a braccio being for him about 50 cms.] of Herculeses, Venuses, Apollinos, Ledas, and other figures of his invention [altre sue fantasie] and, having then cast in bronze by Maestro Jacopo della Barba of Florence, they came out superbly.' Vasari notes that he presented these 'to His Holiness and to molti signori and some of them are now in Duke Cosimo's scrittorio, among over a hundred antique pieces, all rarities, and other modern ones'. The Bargello's bronzes have a Medici provenance. They may derive from models made in about 1530, but Heikamp has shown that the Cleopatra was made in 1544, that the Hercules was first recorded in 1549, and that the group of six was recorded for the first time in detail in an inventory of 1553. Chiarini notes that a document of 1550 reveals that three bronze figures by Bandinelli belonging to Cosimo I were then in the shop of the goldsmiths Domenico and Paolo Poggini who may therefore have been responsible for casting them.

10. Circular inlaid slab of 'marble'specimens serving as a table top
127.7cms. (diameter of slab); 3.7 cms. (depth of slab); 77 cms. (height of table)
Coloured stones arc inlaid into a slab of white Carrara marble in a geometric pattern of scales radiating in increasing sizes from a central micro-mosaic circle. Each scale-shaped piece of stone is outlined in black Belgian marble. The border design is framed in white Carrara marble. The coloured stones include imperial porphyry, granites, serpentines, alabasters, and semi-precious stones as well as marbles. Many are reworked from fragments of ancient Roman architecture (for example, the very distinctive bianco e nero antico, with its jagged pattern of black and white, the Pyrenean quarries of which were only rediscovered in the late nineteenth century), easily available in Rome. Others (most notably the brilliant green malachite from Siberia used for the smallest scales) were imported. The slab is supported by a tripod table veneered in coromandel with dull gilt metal mounts (perhaps not bronze, certainly not fire-gilt).
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. F.27 in his catalogues. The table top was probably bought in Rome in 1852 (see below).
Table tops composed of numerous types of polished stone--and especially reusing the stones the ancient Romans had so esteemed--were perhaps first produced in Italy in the late fifteenth century. A splendid one was made for Isabella d'Este in 1499 out of a great variety of stones including serpentine and porphyry, and others the names of which were unknown (C. M. Brown, ' ""Lo insaciabile desiderio nostro de cose antique"": New Documents for Isabella d'Este's Collection of Antiquities', in C. H. Clough (ed.), Cultural Aspects of the Renaissance: Essays in Honour Of Paul Oskar Kristeller (Manchester, 1976), 349 n. 53). However, I know of no surviving table tops in which a wide variety of stones are displayed in a geometric pattern designed as much for geological instruction as for ornament, which were made before the second half of the eighteenth century. They seem to have been a speciality of Roman craftsmen. One such litoteca with a curvaceous shape and short ormolu paw feet which folds open like a games board was presented in 1763 by Cardinal Riminaldi to his native Ferrara (Il Museo Civico in Ferrara: Donazioni e restauri, ii: Chiesa di San Romano  (Ferrara, 1985), 139-40). A painting by Laurent Pécheux of 1777 shows the Marchesa Boccapaduli in her museum unveiling a monstrance full of butterflies which is supported on an altar, as it were, of marble specimens (reproduced as colour plate XVII in A. González-Palacios, Il tempio del gusto (Roma e il regno delle Due Sicílie), 2 vols. (Milan, 1984) I). The tops were at first rectangular and intended for pier tables in grand apartments. Lalande in the first edition of his Voyage en Italie (Yverdon, 1764, v. 224) mentions such rectangular table tops as a novelty. Francesco (III) of Lorrain, husband of Maria Teresa of Austria, is depicted with such a table in a portrait by Franz Messmer and Ludwig Kohl dated 1773 (eight years after the emperor's death) which is in the Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna, and a very similar table is in the Pitti Palace, Florence (A. Gonzálcz-Palacios, Il tempio del gusto (La Toscana e l'Italia settentionale), 2 vols. (Milan, 1986), i. 144, ii. 299-300). By 1787 when Lalande's second edition appeared (v. 71) they were clearly a well-established fashion. A parallel fashion may be observed in gold boxes including specimens of hardstones which were a speciality of Dresden workshops in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.
An early British reference to table tops of this sort comes in the sale of the stock-in-trade of Thomas Carter in 1777 when a pair of 'inlaid studios of marble' were sold for 20 guineas (Department of Prints and Drawings, British Museum, A-5-9, pp. 54-60). In the same year Henry Blundell bought a specimen table from a marble dealer in the 'Campo Vacino' (sic) and was also presented with one by Pope Pius VI ([H. Blundell], Accound of the #statues, Busts, Bass-Relieves, Cinerary Urns, and Other Ancient Marbles, and Paintings, at Ince, collected by H.B. (Liverpool,1803)). The majority acquired in the late eighteenth century arc likely to have been purchased by gentlemen on the Grand Tour who had throughout the century imported slabs of ancient marble from Rome (as well as pietra dura inlay from Florence) for table tops.
Circular specimen marble table tops appear to have been the nineteenth-century fashion in Britain. Christopher Gilbert (in 'A Specimen Marble Table', Connoisseur (Oct. 1973), 78-81) notes that circular tables with marble, scagliola, mosaic, or marble inlay tops were known as Dejune tables, and were described in George Smith's Designs for Household Furniture of 1808 and in the second edition of his Cabinet-Makers's and Upholsterer's Guide of 1826 as suitable for 'ladies Boudoirs or Morning Breakfast Rooms' and for 'the boudoir or drawing rooms'. The circular form when large, however, may always have been intended for libraries or galleries. Large or small, they are characteristic of the tendency, increasing stcadily in the early nineteenth century, for furniturc to be designed for the centre of a room. It was the circular shape which stimulated more complex patterns in place of the chequerboard.
Two other table tops of the same size and pattern as that in the Ashmolean Museum have come to my attention. One with a massive rosewood support of about 1850 (combining heavy baroque scrolls with Gothic trefoils and Gothic foliage) was lot 146 at Christie's, London, 7 May 1987. Another, supported by three gilt sphinxes in the Empire style which, if original, would date from the first two decades of the nineteenth century and would probably have been made in France, was illustrated in the Connoisseur for July 1965 (p.153). In all cases the central feature is a 'micro-mosaic' reproduction of the famous ancient mosaic found in Hadrian's Villa, and preserved in the Capitoline Museum since 1765, representing three doves drinking from a brazen vessel in which they are partially reflected. In all cases the first and smallest scales are of malachite. There are variations in the colours--for example the largest Scales arc all outlined in black against porphyry in the Ashmolean table top but against giallo antico in the one at Christie's in 1987. The support of the Ashmolean table top with its lion's paw feet and its lion masks at the braced Centres of its three tense scroll supports is an example of early nineteenth-century British furniture at its most bold. It could have been made as early as 1815 or as late as 1855.
One Roman workshop known to have made such work is that of Giacomo Raffaelli (1753-1836). The smaller inlaid table top published in 1973 by Christophcr Gilbert (op. cit.)--3 feet in diameter--is of similar character. The inlaid marble is arranged in a radial pattern forming a star with twenty-four outer points, each 'scale', however, being sharper and the black borders being legible as continuous lines. It is similar also in its use of malachite. A plan and description of this table survives which commences with the information that it was purchased on 8 March 1831 'from the very illustrious Signor Erskine in the establishment of Councillor Giacomo Raffaelli Via del Babuino No. 92--near the Albert Theatre in Rome'. Raffaelli was councillor to the Imperial Russian Court for which he did much work (which explains the use of malachite).
Fortnum also owned two smaller tables of this type. One, which he bequeathed to E. Maude Thompson (F. 28 in his catalogue), had a top of 'Florentine mosaic' with a spray of flowers in pietra dura. He bought it in 1852 in Florcncc and noted that it was the work of 'Cav. Bianchini' of that city. He had it mounted in London on an elaborate tripod support involving terms of Hercules. Another (F. 29), mounted in a similar manner and regarded as a companion, was of 'Roman mosaic'. It featured a central medallion of 'Cupid in the act of' discharging an arrow from his bow' and was made by 'Cav. Barberi' of Rome. This latter table, also acquired in
1852' he bequeathed to Lord Halsbury. In his large catalogue Fortnum did not name the maker of the large table top in the Ashmolean, but in his notebook catalogue he cites this also as the work of Barberi. We may conjecture that it too was acquired in 1852 or possibly a little earlier or later, suggesting or suggested by his acquisition of the smaller example.
Michelangelo Barberi was the leading practitioner of the Roman art of micro-mosaic pictures in the mid-nineteenth century. Like Raffaelli hc had many contacts with Russia. Indeed he was a protégé of the Princess Volkonski and helped establish the mosaic school of St Petersburg. Some of his most celebrated works--the Trionfo d'Amore of 1826, the Twenty Four Hours of Rome of 1839--are in the Hermitage. One might suppose that he only made the central circle of the table top, but there is evidence that mosaicists also supplied the larger marble inlay; indeed Giacomo Raffaelli was also chiefly known for his micro-mosaic although one could (as we have seen) buy table tops from him without any mosaic element. Fortnum could have known of Barberi's work without travelling to Rome for it was awarded a medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1856, when appointed Commendatore del Pontificio Ordine di S. Silvestro, Barberi published engravings of 'Alcuni Musaici usciti dallo Studio del Cav. Michel 'Angelo Barberi'. (M. Alfieri, M. G. Branchetti, D. Petochi, I mosaici minuti romani. (Rome, 1981), 46, 125-30). Two important round micromosaic tabletops, with views of major Italian cities in one case and of the flora and classical ruins of southern Italy in the other, are in the collection of Mr and Mrs Arthur Gilbert and on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (M.77.L81 and L.88.22.3). The supports are of gilt bronze but otherwise similar to that of the Ashmolean table.
Of all the designs reproduced in Roman Micro-mosaic between 1770 and 1870 none exceeded in popularity Pliny's Doves (see Alfieri, Branchetti, and Petochi, op. cit., figs. 13 and 29 and the ten plates on 226-7).",,catalogue text,en

Transferred at an unrecorded date from the Bodleian Librarv where it was recorded in the Gallery by Mrs R. Lane Poole in an appendix to her catalogue of Portraits in the Possession of the University, Colleges, City and County Of Oxford, iii (Oxford, 1925), 308, as follows: 'Cast of Bertolini's [sic] mask believed to have been taken from the mask originally placed on the Poet's Tomb at Ravenna. Presented to the Oxford Dante Society by Baron Kirkup in 1879. Deposited on loan by the Oxford Dante Society in 1916.'
Dante's admirers were not idle in Oxford in the 1910s. Dr Paget Toynbee presented the Bodleian Gallery with a collection of 'all the portralts' of the poet in 1917 and in 1919 the Hon. William Vernon added a plaster cast of Munro's bust of the poet (the marble, which belonged to Henry Acland, had been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856 as no.1304). The quality of the Ashmolean's cast is lamentable and it may have been made by an amateur, the taking of 'squeezes' during the mid-ninetccnth century often being undertaken by gentlemen travellers. The source would seem to have been the terracotta bust in Palazzo del Nero in Florence which was much venerated in the last century because it was believed to have been made from a cast taken after the poet's death in Ravenna in 1321. There is a similar plaster mask, including, however, less of the cap and with less evident seams, in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, the gift of the literary critic Senatore Alessandro d'Ancona. This had previously belonged to Seymour Kirkup (1788-1880), who is recorded as having given the Ashmolean's cast to the Oxford Dante Society shortly before his death. Kirkup was a British painter resident in Florence whose chief claim to fame was his discovery of a presumed portrait of Dante on a wall of the Bargello in the early 1840s. There is no record in M. Tinti's monograph Lorenzo Barolini (2 vols. (Rome,1936)) of the sculptor making a portrait of Dante but it is unlikely that the reference to him is without significance and it is possible that his studio supplied casts of this and other famous Florentine works of all and memorabilia. Bartolini was certainly a strong adherent of the view that the Florentine masks were death masks (which is exceedingly improbable)--see C. Ricci, L'ultimo rifugio di Dante (Florence, 1891), 279-80. An alternative explanation would be that the cast was in fact furnished by Bartolini's rival Stefano Ricci (1765-1837), who was responsible for the poet's cenotaph in S. Croce, Florence (commissioned in 1829), in which the effigy was based closely on the Palazzo del Nero mask.",,catalogue text,en

12. Constantine the Great beholding the sign of the Cross, before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge
81 cms. (height); 98 cms. (length); 80.2 cms. (height of pedestal); 92 cms. (length of pedestal)
Bronze with a dark brown to black patina worn to a chestnut brown n some salient areas (e.g. horse's forelegs, ridges of drapery). Hollow, lost-wax, cast in numerous pieces. Both the back legs and the tail of the horse were separately cast and fixed with difficulties: rivets are apparent and there are cracks in the tail near the join. The front legs were separately cast, but fixed with no visible joins. Constantine's body is cast in two parts--the upper part including both of his arms. The join is apparent on close inspection of the cloak. The fit of the lower part of his body on the horse is ingenious, especially where his cloak fits tightly over the saddle cloth below. Three of the four tassels on the saddle cloth on each side of the horse were separately cast and one is missing from both sides (the tassels nearest the horse's neck are integral with the cloth). The strap across the horse's chest is also attached. The horse's head is cast separately and the join in the upper part of the horse's neck is most evident on the emperor's left side but there is a crack along a part of the join on the other side of the neck. The wall of bronze is very thin in the highest portions of the horse as also in the tail with minute perforations in these parts. A small patch of the mane appears to have been separately inserted. The group is mounted on a pedestal of pale mahogany (modelled on that designed by Michelangelo for the Marcus Aurelius on the Capitol) by means of solid extensions of the back legs.
Purchased 1952 through the agency of Mary Bellis of Charnham Close, Hungerford, from the collection of the American newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Purchased for Hearst at the sale of Leopold Hirsh deceased of 10 Kensington Palace Gardens, London Christi's, London 8 May 1934 (lot 151). The present pedestal seejms to have been made for Hirsch. Previousl in the collection of T.M. Whitehead and in his sale, christi's, London 10th May 1898 (lot 104), at which date it had an ebonized pedestal the top of which was the same shape as the present one. Said in his sale to have been brought from Rome in 1855 by T.W. Faulkner, Esq., of Lime Bank, Cheetham Hill, near Manchester. Mary Bellis was a dealer in antique furniture who had for a breif while a special arrangement to sell works of art from Hearst's home in Wales, St Donat's Castle. See also Nos. 130 and 416.
Bernini's collossal marble statue, upon which this bronze is modelled, is placed, as if in high relief, against the wall of the principal landing of the Scala Regia in the Vatican Palace. it had bfirst been conceived of in the autumn of 1654 in response to an idea of Pope Innocent X to fill a niche in the Basilica of St Peter's and had been blocked out by 1655 when Alexander VII became pope and plans were changed. The present location was decided upon in 1662 and the statue finished in the summer of 1668, transported by January 1669, and unveiled, against a background of agitated stucco drapery, on 1 November 1670. (R. Wittkowcr, Bernini (Oxford, 1981), 251-4.)
The Ashmolean's bronze is a work of hich quality suggestive of a diplomatic gift. It is also the only recorded version in bronze of this masterpiece by Bernini. It is not a copy. The horse rears rather less high than in Bernini's marble and the emperor's right arm is lower (so that his gesture is closer to that devised by Raphael for the mural of the sane subject in the Sala di Costantino of the Vatican). Some of the differences--the trappings on the horse and the antique armour here worn by Constantine--may be explained as appropriate for a less monumental setting, a more ornamental purpose, and perhaps a scholarly patron. Other differences may be explalned by the different medium: the tail in the marble version is attached to the rump and legs, whereas in the bronze it flows free; likewise the cloak in the bronze, where blown back over the flank of the horse, does not adhere as closely to it as in the marble version. None of the differences observed so far precludes the possibility that this is a work made from a modello by Bernini himself. In one or two respects (above all the cuirass) the bronze does correspond with a damaged terracotta bozzetto by Bernini in the Hermitage (G. Matzulevitsch, 'Tre bozzetti di G. L. Bernini', Bolletino. d'arte (1963), 71-2, fig. 3).
It is, however, far more likely that the bronze is the work of a later sculptor. Wittkower (op. cit. 254) suggested the Florentine Giovanni Battista Foggini, who studied in Rome, between 1673 and 1676, under Ercole Ferrata--'the sculptor may have used a Bernini bozzetto as a starting point for his version'. The suggestion is attractive both because Foggini was much involved in equestrian groups in bronze (indeed his Kaiser Joseph I in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich, and his Carlos II in the Prado, Madrid, both have rearing mounts) and because the complex piecing of the bronze is typical of Florentine foundries of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. They were, however, more ingenious in concealing joins. Other sculptors working in Rome (including pensioners of the French Academy) could have been responsible.
The bronze may be considered as a correction of, as well as homage to, the marble, for it avoids the controversial mannerisms of Bernini's late style. The cloak is less abstract in its agitation, more like cloth in its weight, and the horse's mane is less extravagant. The alteration of the emperor's attitude may reflect apprehension concerning the decorum of Bernini's interpretation which is expressed in a polemical pamphlet on the sculptor which deplored the way in which Constantine resembled St Francis receiving the Stigmata (G. Previtah, 'Il Costantino messo alla Berlina o Bernina . . .', Paragone, 13 (1962), 55-8, no.145).",,catalogue text,en

Given by G R. Reitllnger in 1972. The gift, exceptionally, remained in Reitlinger's possession. Much was lost in the fire of 6 February 1978 at his home. What was salvaged was removed to the Museum. The donor died on 8 March 1978. The number corresponds to a card index of some 225 Western ceramic items transferred from the Department of Eastern Art. These were never registered. The cardfor this piece includes Reitlinger's number E. 336 and a note that
it was bought at Phillips and Harris on 3 February 1970.
Reitlinger identified this group as modelled by 'Bongiovanni Vaccaro' about 1840-60. Salvatore and Giacomo Bongiovanni (born 1769 and 1772 respectively) had estabhshed a workshop for the making of small terracotta figurines for cribs and the like at Caltagirone in Sicily by the end of the eighteenth century. Their sister's son, Giuseppe Vaccaro, continued with, and further improved upon, their work, and other members of the family were also employed. Their most ambitious cribs included numerous rural types in local dress, as had long been traditional in southern Italy. Many of these were occupied in a manner quite unrelated to the sacred narrative and these groups--the shepherds making ricotta, the women washing linen in a stream, the old women winding wool, and so on--could presumably also be purchased independently by tourists. The finest compendium of their models is to be found in the crib in the Real Collegiata di S. Maria de Betlem in Modica (Sicily) unveiled on Christmas Eve 1882 (C. Naselli, 'Presepi di Sicilia', Emporium, 74 (1931), 332-7). Scholars who have seen this and the independent figures in Sicilian museum have confirmed the attribution of this piece to the Bongiovanni-Vaccaro workshop, whose productions seem however to have usually been coloured. The style, and extremely skilful management of petals of clay for the ragged clothes, are very closely matched in a piece representing a pedlar or beggar which is stamped 'BONGIOVANNI VACCARO' with raised letters on its base (reproduced Emporium, 34 (1911), 310), and may also be compared with a group of cobblers and a figure of a 'contadino di Bronte' in the collection of crib figures in the Bayerischcrs Nationalmuseum, Munich (vitrine no. 120). Work of this kind was still being made in Caltagirone in this century, by when, however, the standards of modelling had declined. The subjects still continue to be popular, and not only in Sicily--the 'Eleganza Collection of Seattle', which sells reproductions of Renalssance and classical masterpieces in oxolyte, also supplies the Italian-American market with the Contadino con cesti de frutta' che Giustapiatti, Pizzamakers, and other street vendors in this tradition.",,catalogue text,en

The socle has been filled with plaster of Paris to give it weight.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. B. 407 in his catalogues. Bought in Rome for £2 in 1870.
Boschi is described by Charles Heathcote Tatham in a letter of 10 July 1795 to his patron the architect Henry Holland as an 'obscure' artist but one who was recommended by 'Madame Angelica [Kauffmann], Zucchi her husband, Canova, Visconti and Bonomi' (Tatham papers, Victoria and Albert Museum). Tatham, who was supplying Holland with ideas and items for furnishing his interiors, noted that Boschi was much cheaper for work in bronze and ormolu than were the better-known Righetti (see Nos. 79-81) and Valadier whose workshops were evidently extensive. But this, Tatham continued, was explained by the fact that Boschi was 'himself the artist, and not a principal' (i.e. an entrepreneur). We know of few other works signed by Boschi and little has been attributed to him. A small bronze version of Canova's Hebe signed by him was lot 193 at Christie's, London, 11 December 1979, one of the lion on Canova's tomb of Pope Clement XIII was lot 131 at Sotheby's, London 12 April 1990, and one of the Marcus Aurelius was lot 146 at Sotheby's, London, 4 July 1984. A pair of busts of Achilles and Ajax, both after the antique were lot 89 at Christie's, London, 10 December 1991 (the bold signatures, ‘G. BOSCHI F.', not noted in the catalogue). Gordon Balderston has drawn to my attention a small bronze group of a centurion in a two-horsed chariot signed by him (in a private collection). D. Udy, in his catalogue of his stand at the Grosvenor House Antique Dealers Fair, 1966, and Christie's (with Young and Gilling), Hawling Manor, Gloucestershire, 10 October 1988, lot 7, draw attention to small ormolu versions of the Farnese candelabra now in Naples perhaps commissioned by Tatham. A pair of portrait busts of the older and younger Brutus with a finish and technique like the Cicero, of the same size and mounted upon the same type of socle, are displayed as 'French?' and of about 1800 in the Städtische Galerie Liebieghaus, Frankfurt on Main.
There were three ancient busts believed (possibly correctly, it is conceded today) to be portraits of Cicero which Boschi might have taken as his model. The most famous of these was the one later acquired by the duke of Wellington from Cardinal Fesch which had been in the Mattei Collection since the sixteenth century (A. Michaelis, Ancient Marbles in Great
Britain (Cambridge, 1882), 429-30). This shows the philosopher with a bare chest and a marble tablet beneath the chest bearing the name Cicero in lettering which although ancient is thought to be less so than the bust. There are, however, small differences: in the parting of the lips, the curls of hair beside the car, and, more importantly, the corrugations of the brow. There is a closer resemblance to the head in the Capitoline Museum (Sala dei Filosofi, no. 75) which had been in the Barberini Collection-a portrait believed by Visconti to be of Maecenas (Iconografia romana, i (Milan edition of his Works, 1818-37), 171, pl. 12), and a still closer resemblance to the head in the Uffizi probably acquired from the Ludovisi Collection by Grand Duke Ferdinand II de' Medici in 1669 (G. Mansuelli, Galleria degli Uffizi: Le sculture, 2 vols. (Rome, 1958-61), ii. 44-5, no. 33), which is set in lavish onyx drapery. It seems likely that Boschi had access to a cast of the latter.",,catalogue text,en

The attribution of this bronze to Righetti was made by Fortnum presumably because of its similarity in technique, character, and colour to those busts of Bacchus and Ariadne in his collection which are chiselled with Righetti's name (Nos. 80 and 81). In the large catalogue he claims that the bust is after an antique marble in the Vatican but I cannot find a similar statue there. The prototype may be in this country, for in Righetti's printed list of bronzes dated 1794 under 'Bustes avec leur base dorée, en tout, hauts d'un palme, cinq onces' we find 'La fameuse Junon colossale en Angleterre' companion with 'Le Jupiter du Museum Vatican'. The measurement of this bronze Juno, which would only have been approximate, was the same as that for the Bacchus and Ariadne, although at 15 'Sequins Romains' (nearly £7 10s.) it was more expensive. The size of the Ashmolean Juno is close to that of the Bacchus and Ariadne. It is however impossible to feel sure that the bust is not the product of one of the rival foundries of the period. It is different in the cutting of the chest and the modelling has less vitality especially when compared with the Ariadne. An attribution to Boschi is advanced on the grounds that two other versions of the bust are found as companions to versions of the Cicero, which is (in the Ashmolean's example, No. 15) signed by Boschi. In both cases, one in a private collection in London and one with a French dealer from whom they were stolen in late July 1989 (see the Gazette de l'Hôtel Drouot (Sept. 1989), 56), the socles were of gilt bronze of the same type as the Ashmolean's Cicero.",,catalogue text,en

17. Bust of a boy of the Medici family
46.2 cms. (height)
Terracotta of a pinky grey colour, dirty. There is a network of cracks and breaks over the chest, with some plaster infill tinted to match the clay. Much plaster has been poured into the hollow interior of the bust to reinforce it. There is a small hole in the top of the head. Slip-cast and retaining many minute seams from the piece-mould: e.g. across his right eyebrow, across front of fringe.
Given by Thomas Harris of Garden Lodge, Logan Place, London W8. Registered 25 October 1947.
The Register records that the donor believed that the bust was cast from an eighteenth-century mould of an earlier original. Another version of the bust is in the Victoria and Albert Museum (no. 231-1876). There is no surviving documentation for the latter save that it was acquired in 1876 as a bust of 'Il Moro' from a Cesare Brazzini in Florence. If this is the name of a sculptor he is not otherwise recorded, and it may rather be the name of a dealer. The Medici family palle on the breastplate and the coronet above would suggest that a Medici duke was intended, and, given the youth of the sitter and his scowl, there can be little doubt that he is meant for the first Medici duke of Florence, Alessandro de' Medici, natural son of Lorenzo, duke of Urbino. Alessandro was made ruler of Florence in 1530 by the imperial army at the age of 20 and died, murdered by his kinsman, after seven years' rule, the horror of which thrilled the city's late Victorian historians: ""The exaltation of this foul and evil youth to a position of power absolutely uncontrolled showed mankind an example of what human nature is capable of under such conditions', wrote Colonel Young (The Medici (New York, 1910), 365), and he proceeded to quote Adolphus Trollope on the 'low forehead and mean expression' of this boy whose life was one 'continual orgy'. The bust mixes elements suggestive of fifteenth-century sources the pudding-basin hair style, the ornamental breastplate, and the proud look derive chiefly perhaps from Pollaiuolo's terracotta bust of an unknown youth, no. 166 in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, Florence with others contemporary with the sitter-the mask ornament on the front face of the base is inspired by that on the armour of Michelangelo's Giuliano de' Medici- see no. 62). At the same time the boy seems unmistakably to be a contemporary of the fisherboys and urchins of Vincenzo Gemito.
The Victoria and Albert Museum version is exhibited among their fakes but it is not certain that the portrait was intended as such rather than as an imaginary portrait. It is covered, like the Ashmolean version, with piece-mould seams but seems to have been fired in two parts, the back of the head, neck, and shoulders forming a 'lid' cemented on to the
rest.",,catalogue text,en

Courtier of 70 Peppard Road, Caversham, Reading, Berkshire, in March 1984 (deposited early in March, formerly offered and accepted on 15 March). Mr Bowyer died in April, soon after making this gift. Mr Courtier, in a letter to the Keeper of 6 November 1986, explained that Mr Bowyer was a 'bachelor, retired some years as senior partner of the firm Buckland and Sons, Auctioneers and Surveyors of Slough, Windsor and Reading', who had 'spent a long life time collecting pictures & objects d'art, some from his sales but many from second-hand ""junk shops"". If all were not in perfect condition everything had an intrinsic beauty, or antique value; only in his later years did he spend real money! The putti referred to were bought in a very shabby second hand shop in Oxford Rd., Reading in about 1970.' This last date, however, is inaccurate since Mr Bowyer had been in correspondence with the Department of Architecture and Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum concerning the putti in February and March 1956. The department had expressed a tentative interest in purchasing them but only for a 'modest sum' and Mr Bowyer decided not to sell to them.
It is hard to imagine the larger work of art from which these putti must have been removed. Although of identical style and technique they do not certainly form a pair, No. 18 being smaller, most obviously in the head, than No. 19. They may be from a larger group in which such differences mattered less or were intended. Paired putti of about this size, leaning backwards and with one knee raised, sometimes adorn the scrolled feet of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Venetian andirons (see for instance those in the Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, 62-19/1.2). The positions of the arms and the fragments in the hands, however, make such an origin unlikely. No. 18 has a piece of drapery in the hands behind his head and a stem in the other. No. 19 holds thin, striated pieces of foliage or possibly hair in both of his hands. This perhaps suggests that the figures originally held up swags or held back drapery upon the cornice or upper portion of a tabernacle. They bear some resemblance in character to the larger bronze putti supporting the epitaph below the half- length portrait of Lucrezia Tomacelli (duchess of Palliana, wife of Filippo Colonna) on her tomb in the Colonna Chapel in S. Giovanni in Laterano, Rome, a work dated 1625 and made by Teodoro della Porta (legitimate son and heir of Guglielmo della Porta) in collaboration with the founder Giacomo Laurenziani (illustrated and discussed by U. Middeldorf, Raccolta di scritti (Florence, 1981), iii. 97-8, fig. 93).
The putti were registered as German and of the seventeenth or eighteenth century, following the opinion of them expressed in a letter to the donor from the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1956, but the closest parallel is certainly with bronzes which were made in Italy, and in particular with a pair of dancing putti upon small domed bases, of similar size. One of these, with his left foot raised before him, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 109-1910) and the other, with his left foot behind him, is in the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, Florence (inv. 64). They have similarly active and twisted poses, identical wild pointed curls, their extremities also appear to have been clipped off to form sharp points, and the flesh has been given the same distinctive finish with a broad punch. They even have similar fragments in the hands-probably bits of stem and leaf. (The Victoria and Albert Museum has a variant of the Bargello Bronze (A. 78- 1951) and other versions are known, for which see the catalogue of the exhibition Giambologna: Ein Wendepunkt der europäischen Plastik (Vienna, 1978), nos. 255–6, which, however, does not mention the version of the Bargello's putti in the Thiers Collection (no. 131) in the Louvre.) These dancing figures have been attributed to Elia Candido, Elias de Witte of Bruges, because of their resemblance to the larger bronze Aeolus in the Studiolo of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence which is inscribed with this mysterious sculptor's name and dated 1573. Anthony Radcliffe (in the Vienna catalogue cited above) did not find the similarities sufficiently strong to justify the attribution. But the precarious and spiralling pose is extreme in both and the treatment of the hair is very idiosyncratic and exactly comparable. Moreover there is another bronze which shares much with both the dancing putti and the adolescent wind god. This is the graceful Meleager (Staatliche Museen, Berlin-Dahlem, inv. 2594), similar in size to the former (but even smaller) and similar in subject to the latter, who is as delicately balanced (with one foot on a boar's head) and has exactly the same pointed hair and dimpled flesh as the putti (see the persuasive entry by Volker Krahn in Maecenas und Berlin (Ausstellung des Kaiser-Friedrich-Museums-Vereins, 1988), 16-17, attributing this to Candido).",,catalogue text,en

20. Melpomene
41.2 cms. (height excluding socle); 13 cms. (height of socle)
Carrara marble. The turned and waisted socle is of a different piece of marble with the chiselled word 'MELPOMENE' on the front of the tablet above the upper moulding. Inscribed on the back of this tablet in black ink 'S 36 [EF]'. A few minor chips are missing from the vine leaves in the hair.
Bequeathed by C. D. E. Fortnum in 1899. S. 36 in his catalogues. Acquired with Thalia (No. 3).
The Melpomene is companion to Thalia (No. 3), this couple forming a pair for the two copies of antique heads by Gott (Nos. 514, 515). Fortnum noted that it was a 'copy from the head of the antique statue in the Vatican... the work of a student pupil in Canova's studio' but in his preliminary catalogue of 1857 (p. 7) he phrased this rather differently: 'Said to be by one of Canova's pupils and from his studio.' One might suppose that this was supplied by Amici together with the Thalia (No. 3), but if so it is surprising that the socles are of slightly different dimensions and character (and that Thalia does not have her name on the tablet). It may also be that this particular bust was cut down from a failed copy of the entire statue because it is crudely chiselled and hardly at all hollowed out behind and is even rough under the cut of the chest. Like the Thalia the Melpomene is, in execution, an improvement upon the antique prototype, the vine leaves and grape clusters of the Bacchic crown being more sharply defined and deeply undercut and far more completely carved from behind. This prototype is a standing figure with her left leg raised on a block holding a mask in her right hand in the Sala delle Muse in the Museo Pio- Clementino. It was discovered together wth the Thalia and other Muses at the supposed Villa di Cassio at Tivoli in excavations commenced before 1773 by Domenico de Angelis and was obtained for the papal museum by the intervention of Giovanni-Battista Visconti in 1774 (W. Amelung and G. Lippold, Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums, III, (Berlin, 1935-6), no. 499; C.

Bronze with a green and dark brown varnish, flaked and rubbed to expose, in many areas, a yellow metal. The nipples are both of silver, and so is the figure's left eye. The silver has fallen out of her right eye. The figure's right arm, where it is broken, is solid. Her right leg appears solid but has been filled with wax to give this impression. appears The thin wall of the bronze above the break has been twisted and bent. There is a firing crack in the upper part of the figure's left arm. The bronze has been tooled and the cloth which is part of the coiffure has been minutely punched. The figure is mounted by means of a coarse bolt to a slab of imperial porphyry which rests in a plinth of ebonized wood. The slab may originally have served as a plinth for another bronze in the Chamber Hall gift (see No. 223).
Given by Chambers Hall in 1855 (for this gift see the Preliminary Essay to volume iii). Probably placed on display in 1856: blocks for mounting the bronzes were paid for in January of that year.
This fragment of an exquisite bronze figure, known only in this cast, was formerly labelled as possibly by Guglielmo della Porta, because the reclining pose was thought to be similar to those of the personifications on the tomb of Pope Paul III by that sculptor in St Peter's. This attribution was probably proposed, and certainly approved, by C. F. Bell. It was, however, Bode's opinion that the figure, which he erroneously captioned as in the Pierpont Morgan Collection, might be by Benvenuto Cellini (Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii, pl. CXLVI). Planiscig agreed, although correspondence with Bell makes it clear that he knew the bronze only from photographs (Piccoli bronzi italiani del Rinascimento (Milan, 1930), 45). Pope-Hennessy also considered it as possibly by Cellini (The Life of Benvenuto Cellini Written by Himself (London, 1949), 484) and has recently reaffirmed this position:
""One small bronze of a reclining female nude, which exists only in a single version at Oxford may also have been produced by Cellini at this time [1546]. It has no provenance (no provenance of consequence, that is), but the exquisite modelling of the figure is so closely related to the Earth on the Vienna saltcellar as to permit a tentative attribution to Cellini."" (Cellini (London, 1985), 226)
The somewhat elongated proportions; the pose, intermediary between reclining and sitting, which is certainly reminiscent of the see-saw attitudes of Ops and Neptune on the salt-cellar; the elaborately dressed hair which nevertheless retains  the freedom, body, and softness; also the exquisite silver additions characteristic of goldsmith's work; all tend to support connection with Cellini. Two factors, however, weigh against the attribution. Firstly, Cellini's surviving bronzes, large and small, are all of a highly coppery metal with a warm brown natural patina, whereas this is the colour of brass. Secondly, the woman's face with its pointed dimpled chin and its arched brows rising from a fine nose is dissimilar to the female type which is found in Cellini's work which is particularly distinguished by square brows. It may be significant that before the compilation of this catalogue no photographs of the bronze gave a frontal view of the face. Draper, in his 1980 edition of Bode's Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance, suggested that the bronze was Roman and of about 1570-80.
It is not only the identity of the creator of this bronze which is mysterious. Its original purpose and setting are also hard to imagine. It perhaps served as an ornament on an elaborate inkstand. It is impossible to believe that a sculpture would have been so highly finished in a fragmentary form so the damage must have occurred subsequently. It is possible to imagine a firing crack in the arm, especially if it were solid, causing it to break in half when dropped, and it is easy to imagine that the leg, being so thin, could be broken. It is odd, however, to find a cast with such an extreme variation in thickness.",,catalogue text,en

Bought at Christie's, London, 22 June 1950, lot 67, 'the property of Frances, Lady Ashburton'. Acquired by Alexander Hugh Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton, between 1860 and 1889 (probably nearer the latter date).
Tantalizingly little is known of Claus. In addition to these busts, there is a reduced marble copy of the Apollino of the Tribuna signed 'Josephus Claus fecit 1766' at Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire, a bust signed by him at Maddesfield Court (note in the Department's files), a bust of a man at the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, and a bust of Clement Augustus, archbishop elector of Cologne (1700-61), signed 'Joseph Claus invt. et fect. 1754', in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight (E. Morris and M. Evans, Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight: Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, Drawings, Miniatures, Tapestries, Post-Classical Sculpture and Prints (Liverpool, 1983), 109, no. LL202, X4202). Gerald Taylor has observed ('Uno scultore ignoto Joseph Claus', Bollettino d'arte, 3 (July-Sept. 1952), 231-3) that Claus is not mentioned in the records of the Academy of St Luke. This might suggest that he stayed for only a relatively short period in Rome-at least a brief visit is suggested by the portrait busts of the popes, and by the style of his work. His name suggests that he came from Germany and the portrait of the archbishop elector, a lover of Italian art, might suggest a patron by whom he was sent to Rome. However, as Hugh Honour pointed out in a letter to Hugh Macandrew of 27 July 1969, it was from a Giuseppe Claus that Canova took over a largish studio in Vicolo delle Colonette di S. Giacomo degli Incurabili in 1783 in order to carve the monument to Pope Clement XIV. If this is the same Claus one wonders how he was employed in Rome between 1766 and 1783.
The popes depicted are Innocent XIII (Conti) who died 1724, Benedict XIII (Orsini) who died 1730, Clement XII
(Corsini) who died 1740, and Benedict XIV (Lambertini) who died 1758. The last named pope was therefore alive when the bust of him was carved whereas the others were posthumous, and this might explain (as Taylor pointed out, op. cit.) the different styles of signature, 'invenit' being absent from the portrait of the living pope because invention was less important when a work was executed from the life. On the other hand the sculptor might have wished to underline the imaginative contribution he made in those cases when he was inevitably dependent upon the models of earlier artists. He certainly was dependent upon the bronze bust of Clement XII by Pietro Bracci in the Museo Capitolino of 1736 for his portrait of that pontiff (as Taylor noted). However physiognomical truth seems to have been modified in the interest of decorative symmetry. Claus's Benedict XIV resembles Innocent XIII and Benedict XIII resembles Clement XII. All four have a very similar undulating termination to the mozzetta which in every case is imperfectly buttoned and each pope has a similarly curling collar in every case supported by marble bridges, but on closer examination they are paired in attire as well as facial type: Benedict XIV and Innocent XIII have polished marble (for satin?) mozzettas and caps
whereas the busts of Benedict XIII and Clement XII have mozzettas and caps with rougher punched textures (for velvet ?); the former pair have stoles with a punched ground whereas the latter pair wear stoles with a striated ground.
Strikingly similar to these busts, not only in formal, costume, and size but in execution, is that of Clement XIV now in the Vestibolo Quadrato (formerly Stanza della Cleopatra) in the Vatican Museums, which was acquired earlier in this century from the Galleria Sangiorgi (with an attribution to Canova which now seems absurd).
In addition, the bust of Benedict XIV in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan (no. 1314) is a truncated version of that in the Ashmolean and so perhaps a product of Claus's studio.",,catalogue text,en

26. Virgin and Child
63.5 cms. (height); 39.5 cms. (width)
White marble, presumably from Carrara, with some ingrained dirt in the finer hollows. Framed in a wood frame partially black and partially gilded.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. S. 7 in his catalogues. Bought in 1864 from the executors of 'the late Sig. Lombardi' [Francesco Lombardi] for £20 (according to the notebook catalogue). As mentioned in the introduction Fortnum also bought Italian paintings from Lombardi's collection.
Fortnum considered that 'the delicate and tender expression and fine execution of this marble are much in the manner of Desiderio'. In the notebook catalogue it is clear that the 'much' replaced a 'quite' and that the prudent qualification that it 'may be by some equally able pupil of Donatello's school' was an afterthought. He was aware of another version of the relief in the Galleria Reale, Turin, which he described, rashly, as a copy or 'replica'. The Turin Madonna is now generally (and surely correctly) regarded as a masterpiece by Desiderio: N. Gabrielli's opinion in her catalogue of that collection (Galleria Sabauda: Maestri italiani (Turin, 1971), 261, no. 167) that it is an imitation by Bastianini has not met with support. It was bought in Florence by Baron Garriod in 1850 and casts may well have been taken from it in this period. In any case numerous stucco reproductions of it exist, most of them purporting to be, and many of them certainly looking like, fifteenth-century works (see L. Cardellini, Desiderio da Settignano (Milan, 1962), figs. 369-74). From one of these Fortnum's version could easily have been carved.
Bell, in his annotations to Fortnum's large catalogue, recorded Bode's opinion that the Ashmolean's relief was a 'modern copy', and noted the great superiority of the relief in Turin, but he kept the piece on display in the Fortnum Gallery and in his Summary Guide of 1931 described it as 'school of Desiderio da Settignano' (p. 23). Kenneth Garlick informed Anthony Radcliffe in a letter of 19 October 1973 that he had just put it up in the redecorated Fortnum Gallery for better or for worse'. Radcliffe was then helping John Pope-Hennessy's research into the forging of Florentine quattrocento sculpture, research which resulted in Pope- Hennessy's paper, first published in Apollo in 1974, entitled ""The Forging of Italian Renaissance Sculpture', in which Bode's opinion that the relief was a fake was repeated. ""The relief differs', Pope-Hennessy correctly observes, from that in Turin, 'in the overall flattening of the forms, e.g. of the drapery beneath the Virgin's right forearm and of the Child's right hand, and in the misunderstanding of certain passages, e.g. in the decoration of the Virgin's dress on the right shoulder and the buttoning of her sleeve, represented with a third button and a seam that are not present in the original.' (J. Pope-Hennessy, The Study and Criticism of Italian Sculpture (Princeton, NJ, 1980), 267 n. 30.) The argument that the variations were stimulated by deficiencies in a cast of the original in Turin is persuasive. The relief certainly looks like a copy and probably (but not certainly) of the mid- nineteenth century, rather than of the fifteenth. Whether, if it is of the mid-nineteenth century, it was made to deceive, it is impossible to ascertain. For Lombardi see No. 27.",,catalogue text,en

Pietra serena (fine-grained grey-green Fiesole sandstone). Unfinished. All the edges of the block of stone are chipped and irregular. The lower corner to proper right has broken off but has been reattached. 'S. /5./[EF]' is painted in black on this corner. The relief is set in a gilded wood frame of the 'Salvator Rosa' type but with an arched top and foliate ornament in the spandrels.
Given by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888. S. 5 in his catalogues. Bought 'from Lombardi [Francesco Lombardi] in Florence in 1859', for 17 gold Napoleons according to a receipt and certificate dated 16 February and signed by Lombardi which is stuck in the notebook catalogue. (It cost £14 10s. according to the separate 'Memoranda of prices paid'.) Said by Lombardi to have come from the Palazzo Brunaccini-Compagna, Florence (see below).
Fortnum considered this unfinished schiacciato relief to be one of the masterpieces in his collection. He found the 'admirable folds of the drapery' and 'noble expression of the heads' comparable even with the celebrated relief, also in pietra serena, of an ideal female profile bust then regarded as of St Cecilia. This latter relief, now in the Toledo Museum of Art, had also been sold by Francesco Lombardi, the distinguished Florentine jeweller, goldsmith, and art dealer to 'an Englishman'. It was said to have come from the same source, Palazzo Brunaccini-Compagna, and was attributed by Lombardi to the same artist, Donatello. The Englishman who had bought the St Cecilia was either Samuel Woodburn or someone acting for him. At Woodburn's sale on 15 May 1854 it was bought by Mr Rickman 'of Duke St.' for Lord Elcho (not, as recently asserted, by a Mr Hickman acting independently). Fortnum also related his relief to another one in pietra serena of the Virgin and Child acquired for the South Kensington (now the Victoria and Albert) Museum in 1861 with the Gigli-Campana Collection (7582-1861). This was, with the St Cecilia, for the half-century between 1880 and 1930, one of the most admired, reproduced, and imitated of all Renaissance sculptures.
Lombardi sold the relief to Fortnum with a certificate quoting the opinions of the eminent Florentine sculptors and academicians Emilio Santarelli and Vincenzo Consavi that it was by Donatello and came from the same source as the St Cecilia. Fortnum at first accepted this but he altered the in his notebook catalogue-he was now 'inclined to entry attribute these works to Desiderio rather than Donatello' and with this view most subsequent scholars agreed after the exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1888. Not long after Fortnum's death, however, Bode, the world's leading authority on Italian sculpture, visited Oxford and expressd doubts about the relief. C. F. Bell noted in the margin of Fortnum's large catalogue Bode's opinion that it was a forgery, perhaps by the same hand as No. 26. (He also noted the opinion of the Donatello scholar P. Schubring that the material was not pietra serena but verde di Prato.) Bell kept the relief on display in the Fortnum Gallery and in his Summary Guide of 1931 described it as 'school of Desiderio da Settignano' (p. 23). Doubts had also been expressed concerning the St Cecilia before 1910 but not by Bode who, however, did also believe that the Victoria and Albert Museum's relief was fake.
In a paper first published in Apollo in 1974 entitled ""The Forging of Italian Renaissance Sculpture', J. Pope-Hennessy grouped the three reliefs which Fortnum had first associated and cited three others in the same material as also being by the same hand: a portrait of a lady in the Detroit Institute of Art, a Virgin and Child sold in Zurich in 1909 (Hommel Sale, 10-18 August, lot 1149) and a portrait of a lady in Berlin, concluding that 'there can be no reasonable doubt that all of these six pietra serena reliefs belong together, were planned by a single mind, and date from the middle of the nineteenth century'. (The Study and Criticism of Italian Sculpture (Princeton, NJ, 1980), 235). He proposed that they were made by a Florentine sculptor, Odoardo Fantacchiotti (1809-77), for the dealer, jeweller, and goldsmith Francesco Lombardi (1787-1864).
This hypothesis has met with widespread acceptance. But it is not proven. Lombardi is described as 'one of the principal instigators and one of the main vendors of forged sculptures' in Florence (ibid. 233), but no evidence is produced to support this claim. His tomb, erected by his heirs in S. Croce, incorporates what is now thought of as a very accomplished pastiche of a relief by Donatello, which Lombardi had given to the church in his lifetime. But, if it is a pastiche, might not Lombardi have been deceived by it? Surely genuine pride and piety, a desire to associate himself with a great work of Florentine devotional art and to gain credit for giving it to the public (for S. Croce is a museum of sorts), is more probable than Pope-Hennessy's proposal that he enjoyed the idea of continuing to fool connoisseurs after his death. As for Fantacchiotti, there is no very close relationship between the style of the pietra serena reliefs and the accomplished blend of neo-classicism with a quattrocento relief style found in his tondo of the Virgin and Child in the tomb of Raphael Morghen in S. Croce and in that on the Giuntini monument in S. Giuseppe, both completed in 1854, (illustrated by Pope-Hennessy, The Study and Criticism of Italian Sculpture, 230- 1, pls. 15 and 16). There is little sign in these reliefs of the distinctive mannerisms of those in Oxford and the Victoria and Albert Museum which derive from a study of Desiderio: the flattening of volumes (so that eyelids, fingers, limbs, and haloes seem to have been cut out of card or very thin dough), the rhyming of drapery folds and edges (so that, for example, the edge of the Virgin's sleeve in Oxford or one end of the openings in the cuff are aligned with folds in the drapery behind), the tremulous undulations of the Virgin's hair. Fantocchiotti had a genuine feeling for quattrocento art and was doubtless capable of mimicking it, but there were other sculptors of whom this was no less true-Ulisse Cambi, for instance, whose tomb in SS Annunziata for Marchese Luigi Tempi-Malzimedici, dated 1849, includes angels imitated from Luca della Robbia and a floral border imitated from Ghiberti, or the Venetian Vincenzo Favenza, who between 1849 and 1853 carved the boxwood dining room doors for Kingston Lacy in Dorset, imitating works by Donatello, Luca della Robbia, and Jacopo Sansovino, as well as the antique, as prescribed by his patron the connoisseur William Bankes (1786-1855).
Little is known of Fantacchiotti's carcer and few works are attributed to the last years of his life, but this is true of many artists. There is nothing strange in reference books only listing carly works by which artists first established a reputation. In fact Fantacchiotti was at work on the ambitious and acclaimed Susanna (signed 1872, Musco d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Pitti, Florence) in his later years and not merely engaged on minor monuments. And even if diminished productivity in the second half of his career were established there are numerous explanations for this other than the clandestine activity as a forger implied by Pope-Hennessy's observation that 'There is no telling what he was up to during the crucial years when foreign collectors and museums were engaged in the block buying of Italian sculptures', (ibid. 230-1). Elsewhere in his paper Pope-Hennessy discusses the case of Giovanni Bastianini, who was exposed as a forger in 1867, and remarks that as well as being trained at the Florentine Academy under Pio Fedi he 'may also have worked under Fantacchiotti; in any case the two sculptors must have known each other well' (ibid. 237). He 'may' have worked under Fantacchiotti, but there is no reason to suppose that he did: he would probably have 'known' Fantacchiotti, but there is no reason to suppose that they were friends or associates.
The possibility that all three pietra serena reliefs grouped by Fortnum, the Toledo St Cecilia, the Victoria and Albert Museum's Virgin and Child and the Ashmolean Museum's unfinished Virgin and Child, are Renaissance works should be reconsidered. When compared with the works of Desiderio da Settignano, such as the reliefs in the Bargello and in the Galleria Reale in Turin or the exquisite fragment of a pietra serena relief of the Virgin and Child in the Musée at Lyons (I. Cardellini, Desiderio da Settignano (Milan, 1962), 121–2, 136-8, Fig. 323), which inspired them, it is impossible to believe that the Victoria and Albert and the Ashmolean reliefs are by Desiderio (I have not studied the St Cecilia). But Desiderio was imitiated in the fifteenth century as well as in the nineteenth.
It is true that to most expert eyes today both the Virgin and Child reliefs have a modern 'look' but this is due to the great influence which the Victoria and Albert Museum relief enjoyed in the early decades of this century—a striking example of which is the marble head of the Virgin of 1922-3 by the young Henry Moore. No one could claim that the styles of the 1850s betray themselves in these works.",,catalogue text,en

Fortnum described this as an Electro-deposit by Franchi from the work by Donatello in the Museum, Lambras, at Vienna [the Schloss Ambras Collection then on display in the Lower Belvedere]. Some portions of the original work are picked out with gold as the shield and fibula of the soldier, the sarcophagus &c. this has been reproduced in the deposit. Many years ago, I noticed this fine and highly elaborated work in a dark corner of the Ambras Museum and was most courteously permitted to have a cast taken from it, which was subsequently photographed at Venice [perhaps an error for Vienna], and from which the deposit was taken by Mr Franchi for the S.K.M. [South Kensington Museum]. It is engraved in Perkins Italian Sculptures. Supp'. p. 274. This relief which has, since 1891, been in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (inv. 6059), is no longer regarded as a 'noble work in Donato's most forcible manner', as Fortnum proposed, but as the work of a follower, perhaps indebted to Mantegna as well as to Donatello. It is surely by the same artist as the no less mysterious bronze, gold, and silver mirror, the so-called Martelli Mirror, in the Victoria and Albert Museum (8717-1863) where one finds the same minute attention to folds and creases of drapery and skin and the same frozen expressions-a point not made in the admirable entry on the relief by M. Leithe-Jasper in Renaissance Master Bronzes from the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (National Gallery of Art, Washington (and elsewhere), 1986), 61-4, no. 4.
According to Leithe-Jasper the attribution to Donatello goes back to E. von Sacken's Kunstwerke und Geräthe des Mittelalters und der Renaissance in der Kais. Kön. Ambreser Sammlung in Originalphotographien (undated but Vienna, 1865). Fortnum, however, was not inclined to exaggerate his own discoveries; had the work been published when it was 'noticed' by him he would certainly have been told as much (since he must have had dealings with the curatorial staff in order to have a cast taken from it) and he was invariably scrupulous in recording such references. It is likely therefore that von Sacken took the attribution from Fortnum. His cast was made in the winter of 1865 and 1866 when Franchi was in Florence and Pisa making casts for the South Kensington Museum and Fortnum had a plaster of it made for presentation to that institution—the business is described in Fortnum's letter to Henry Cole of 10 January 1866 in the Victoria and Albert Museum. That Franchi was active in the making of electrotypes is clear from Fortnum's comment in his Bronzes of 1877, that 'electro deposit as carried out by Messrs Elkington and the late Signor Franchi' had been a 'singular success'. An idea of Franchi's talents as an original craftsman may be obtained from the casket he cast and chased to contain the memorandum of the Great Exhibition in 1871 (Victoria and Albert Museum 319-1872). His family firm were to become the principle rivals of Brucciani (see Nos. 450, 580, 581) as suppliers of academic plaster casts.
In 1867 Fortnum acquired in Florence a fine plaquette of the Deposition (B. 615 in his catalogue) which he believed to be 'by Riccio or the master himself' (i.e. Donatello), which is now regarded as by Riccio but inspired by Donatello's relief (in stone, but thought by Fortnum to be in terracotta) made 1446-50 for the altar of the Santo in Padua which must also be the starting-point of the relief in Vienna.",,catalogue text,en

The plaquette with the goat (30) is endorsed in white paint 'B./684/[EF]', the one with the 'ghost' (31) with 'B./685/[EF]'.

The relief of the revelling children with a goat derives from a composition invented by Duquesnoy. Bellori relates how this sculptor made a relief of divine love fighting profane love, and another relief, the same size, of a bacchanal of putti dragging by the horns and beating a goat and including one boy frightening some others with a mask. The wax model was copied in porphyry by Tomaso Fedele of Rome, 'Tomaso del porfido', who was celebrated for fashioning this notably hard material with precision and softness. Bellori notes that the mezzo-rilievo by Tomaso after Duquesnoy was given by Cardinal Francesco Barberini to King Philip IV of Spain. In fact the relief by Tomaso is after the first of these compositions, the Sacred and Profane Love, payments for which were made in 1631. A marble relief of the bacchanal in the Doria Pamphili Collection has been dated to about 1626 (C. Noehles, 'F. Duquesnoy: Un busto ignoto e la cronologia delle sue opere', Arte antica e moderna (1964), 90, 93-4, n. 25; for Bellori see G. P. Bellori, Le vite de' pittori, scultori e architetti moderni, ed. E. Borea (Turin, 1976), 289–90). A notable seventeenth-century version of the goat composition is the one in black marble in the Villa Borghese (no. 508, reproduced in M. Fransolet, 'François du Quesnoy', Mémoires de l'Académie Royale de Belgique, 2nd series 9 (1942)). But if the composition originated in this complex scene of twelve actors it was soon reduced to eight, as in the ivory in the Victoria and Albert Museum (no. 1061, companion with no. 1064, a group of the putti around a goat which is milked by a satyr), to six, as here, or to four, as in the fictive frieze below the portrait of a man with a view of St Peter's by Hendrik Frans Van Lint (Copper, Slate and Marble (Hazlitt Gooden and Fox, Oct. 1967), no. 30). The composition of the children playing at ghosts (or blind man's buff, as Fortnum supposed) was much repeated in the eighteenth century but is of uncertain origin: it might be considered as a development of the theme initiated by Duquesnoy with his putto holding a mask (itself a development of an idea found on antique cameos).
Gilt bronze or copper plaquettes of this type are sometimes found applied to luxury furniture in the eighteenth century. Such might well have been the purpose for which these examples were made. There is a pair of plaquettes of dancing and fighting putti of similar size in the Hermitage (M. Lopato, Western European Plaquettes... the Hermitage Collection (Leningrad, 1976), 63, no. 165, inv. 17551). The pretty landscape setting in the Ashmolean's reliefs also suggests an eighteenth-century date, but does not exclude a late seventeenth-century one.

90.2 cms. (height including integral plinth); 4 cms. (height of plinth); 35.2 cms. (diameter of plinth)
Carrara marble. 'PIO FEDI SCULTORE FIORENTINO' is chiselled behind the figures on the upper surface of the octagonal plinth with 'FECE NEL 1872' in smaller capitals on a separate line. On the front of the same plinth and also on the upper surface is chiselled in decorated letters 'RICORDITI DI ME' to left of his left shoe, 'CHE SON LA PIA' to right, the capital 'R' and 'P' being larger and more decorated, and also on another line 'DANTE', to left of the shoe and 'PUR. C. V to right. There are numerous chips and losses to the lower moulding and the hollow of the octagonal base especially beside the left foot of Nello. Projecting drapery at the back of the group has also been broken. The pommel of his sword hilt and the end of the scabbard are missing. There are holes, regular in shape and penetrating carved areas in a manner which makes it seem unlikely that they are flaws in the marble, possibly caused by a pointing machine-large ones are on the back on his tunic and on the back of her right arm, smaller ones on her right breast and shoulder and in the back of her dress.
When acquired, the marble was covered in a dirty yellow film with some black encrustation in the less conspicuous parts of the drapery and a few (test?) patches of clean and polished white marble. The sculpture had been filthy (but not apparently from exposure outside, since there was no evidence of frost damage) and cleaning had been attempted with an acidic solution, the surface thereby losing its original textures. Cleaning was continued in the conservation laboratories of the Ashmolean Museum's Department of Antiquities, by Kathleen Kimber under the direction of Mark Norman, with distilled water steam and some acetone. The holes, already mentioned, were filled and the surface was then slightly waxed.
Purchased for £2,676 (hammer price £2,400) at Sotheby's, London, 10 June 1988, lot 140, from the France Fund, with a contribution of £1,320 from the Museums and Galleries Commission's Regional Fund administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum. The group arrived in the Museum on 28 June, but was in the conservation studio throughout 1988 and 1989. Put on display in the Combe Room in December 1989.
The group illustrates the final lines (130-6) of the fifth Canto of Dante's Purgatorio (one of which is chiselled on the plinth):
'Deh, quando tu sarai tornato al mondo,
e riposato della lunga via,'
sequitò il terzo spirito al secondo,
'ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
Siena mi fe', disfecemi Maremma:
salsi colui che innanellata, pria
disposando, m'avea con la sua gemma.'
Which may be translated:
The third spirit upon the second followed:
'Pray, when the living world you have regained,
And taken rest from this long road,
Remember me who was La Pia named.
Born in Siena: undone in the marshy land
Of Maremma. How is known to him who claimed
Me with a ring; who held me in his hand.'
Nineteenth-century commentators on Dante believed La Pia to be a lady of the Sienese family of Tolomei who married Nello d'Ighiramo, captain of the Tuscan Guelphs, and was put to death by him in 1295 at Castello della Pietra, in the Sienese Maremma, out of jealousy (unfounded, according to some). The manner of her death was said to have been confinement in a place where marsh air was fatal. Banchi in his commentary of 1886 proved that this identification was impossible. The subject was also treated by Domenico Trentanove in an imaginary bust portrait dated 1886 (Museo d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Pitti, Florence) and by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in a finished drawing in a private collection and in a painting in the Spencer Art Gallery of the University of Kansas at Lawrence (1868). Whereas Rossetti showed the lady languishing in the Maremma, Pio Fedi represents her with her husband. The moment may be that at which suspicion steals into the husband's mind to the dismay of his innocent wife, or that at which intimations of his plans dawn upon her. Theodosia Trollope had no doubts:
The group represents the ill-fated lady, at the moment when her husband prepared to leave her all alone in the dreary old tower of the Maremma, which is yet pointed out as the scene of her piteous ending. Laying one arm around his shoulder, she bends forward and looks into his averted face with anxious forboding, as though enquiring how soon he will return. He meanwhile gazes gloomily at the ground, wrapping himself in the blackness of his evil thought, and shrinking from the pleading eyes of his victim. He seems rather to be waiting for the sound of his horse's hoofs on the stones without, and chafing at its delay, than listening to her timid words of inquiry. ('Notes on the Most Recent Productions of Florentine Sculptors', Part III, Art Journal (1 July 1861), 210–11)
This group may come as a surprise to those whose acquaintance with Pio Fedi's sculpture has been confined to the more conspicuous public monuments by him in Florence the once famous Rape of Polyxena (executed 1860-5 from an earlier plaster) which was erected by public subscription in the Loggia dei Lanzi, the statues of the sculptor Nicola Pisano and of the botanist and anatomist Andrea Cesalpino in the series of great Florentines filling the niches of the Uffizi (both commissioned in 1846), the monument to General Manfredo Fanti of 1872 in Piazza San Marco, or the Liberty on the monument to Niccolini of 1883 in Santa Croce. In its shallow relief and its costume accessories it reminds us of Fedi's training as a goldsmith and engraver, An interest in quattrocento sculpture found in the exquisite low relief of this group can also be seen in the figures on the base of the Fanti monument and he in fact created a number of sculptures of historical subjects involving virtuoso marble carving for instance his Beatrice Cenci at her Trial or his infant Christopher Columbus seated half-nude on the shore among the sea shells earnestly launching a model boat (a group dated 1886)—and he was also interested in sweetly ornamental gallery sculpture which represented mental disturbance, intriguing because inaccessible to us-as in his Secret, a group of a mother carnestly listening to a confidence whispered by her son, or his Chrysalis in which a young nude girl contemplates with perplexity a cocoon from which a butterfly is emerging, an emblem of her own puberty. Versions of these sculptures were numbers 89, 91, 224, and 225 in Fedi's atelier sale in Florence on 28, 30 April and 1 May 1894 (catalogue in French, sale 'sous la direction de Mr G. Sangiorgi'), where a version of this group 108 cms. high signed 'Pio Fedi scolpì' featured as no. 223 (illustrated) together with a twisted column pedestal of verde di Prato 103 cms. high. In addition there were two plaster casts (lots 97 and 194) and the first maquettes, also in plaster (lots 35 and 43), of the group.
The group of La Pia and Nello was originally made as a model in 1846 and commissioned as a full-size marble, to match Dupré's Dante and Beatrice, by the Grand Duke Leopold II in the same year (the contract was dated
17 November). Final payment was made on 31 May 1848 and at the end of that year or early in 1849 a repetition was commissioned. One of these two versions was placed in the grand ducal gardens at Poggio Imperiale. Neither has been traced. (Cultura neoclassica e romantica nella Toscana granducale (Palazzo Pitti, Florence, 1972), 75-6, no. 12, entry by Sandra Pinto.) Leopold II took special interest in the Maremma as a subject (the marshes were then being drained) and he also commissioned from Enrico Pallastrini (1817-76) a painting of Nello at the tomb of La Pia. He also took a special interest in Pio Fedi, paying for him to study in Rome earlier in the 1840s. The group remained immensely popular and Fedi made a number of replicas on a reduced scale. The earliest of these would seem to be that dated 1861, and exhibited in that year at the Esposizione Italiana di Firenze, which is now in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Pitti (Cultura neoclassica..., op. cit.). All the later versions seem to have been bought by British visitors to Florence for whom the exquisite textures, miniature detail, medieval dress, and psychological drama were already familiar from the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites. It is in fact tempting to propose that the lost original version of Fedi's group was an influence on Holman Hunt's Claudio and Isabella (completed 1850) and Munro's Paolo and Francesca (completed in plaster by 1851). Mrs Trollope when she visited Fedi's studio in Via Chiara (near that of Hiram Powers) noted that the group was 'being twice repeated on commission for London, the one for Mr Overend, the other for Mr N. Clayton' (op. cit.). She noted that there are not wanting distinguished art judges who rank this 'poetical little group' on a level with 'Signor Fedi's colossal Pyrrhus and Polyxena'.
The versions she mentions are likely to be identical with two sold in London in recent years--at Sotheby's, 6-7 November 1986, lot 307 bearing the inscription 'Pio Fedi Statuario di Firenze Sculpi 1862', and at Sotheby's, 18- 21 March 1988, Lot 120 signed 'Sculptor. P. Fedi. Fior"", without a date. This latter version (purchased by Anthony Roth, then of Maddox Street), which is in exceptionally good condition, has a narrower original plinth than the others (diameter 27 cms.) and also a separate octagonal base. It is also considerably smaller (67.6 cms. high including the 2 cms. high plinth). In these versions and the Ashmolean's the detailing is different: for instance, the rope by which her purse is suspended and the tassels hanging from it, the ornament on his sword belt, the patterns of the brocade. Careful variations such as this are impossible in routine studio reproductions, and the date of 1872 on the Ashmolean's version, not being the date of the first reduced version, is surely a further indication of its status as a special replica by Fedi himself the creation of which he felt to be worth documenting. It is noteworthy that in the Ashmolean version some symbolism is probably intended in the patterns of the brocade: there are dragons on his sleeves and putti play with birds in the panels of her dress. Similar versions and variants are recorded of Fedi's La Fiorentina, dated 1874, in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, which seems to be the only other recorded statue by him in a public collection in Britain (see Walker Art Gallery: Foreign Catalogue (Liverpool, 1977), no. 4226, pp. 298-9).
Mrs Trollope noted that Fedi had tried to repeat the success of this group with another of Ippolito Buondelmonte with Dianora de' Bardi which was in course of execution in 1861.",,catalogue text,en

Earthenware of a pinky cream colour (warmer in tone than its companion No. 34). The glaze is very slightly green where gathered, very slightly crazed in places, and worn and chipped in a few small arcas. The left foot of Bacchus is broken off and the toes lost, two fingers of the left hand of Ariadne are broken off and lost, the left arm of Bacchus is broken at the shoulder and repaired with ugly discoloured adhesive apparent in the join and chipped edges to it, and a large chip is missing from the base, front proper right (this is the only recent damage). The group was cast in four the parts: base (which is hollow below); the two figures (hollow only in the thickest parts); and the urn (apparently hollow), all of which would have been assembled before firing. The leaves and grapes were also evidently separately modelled and dropped into place at this stage- many of these are chipped or have fallen off, which might be carly damage.
Purchased from David Pickup Ltd. of 15 High Street, Burford, together with No. 34 for £1,250 on 5 March 1989 with a contribution of £625 from the Regional Fund administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the remainder coming from the Reginald Jones Bequest Fund. The groups were seen by Gerald Taylor in Late January 1989 and taken to the Museum on 30 January. Purchased by Mr Pickup at the sale of Hill Court, Herefordshire, in 1986.
This group, representing Bacchus introducing Ariadne to viticulture, seems to have been designed by Foggini as a bronze. Several casts are known in this medium: one is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington (exhibited The Twilight of the Medici (Gli ultimi Medici) (Detroit and Florence, 1974), no. 297); another is in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu (83.SB.333); another is in the Musée Nissim de Camondo, Paris (no. 110); another in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris (n. 251-formerly Bardini Collection); and others are in private collections (see catalogue entry by J. Montagu in the catalogue of the exhibition just cited, in the unpaginated addenda). Most of these bronze groups are paired (or are known to have once been paired) with a group of Venus and Cupid also by Foggini.
The group was evidently also made in terracotta, and subsequently in porcelain by the Doccia factory, for a late eighteenth-century inventory of models includes a 'Gruppo di Arianna e Bacco. La detta Arianna in alto di premere l'uva in un vaso, di terra cotta con forma. Del Foggini.' The piece- mould survives in the factory's museum (K. Lankheit, Die Modellsammlung der Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 1982), 127, pl. 123). The porcelain version (as reconstructed from the surviving moulds) differed in no essential respects from the bronze except that the grapes are held less high by Bacchus and connect with the grapes in his hair which thus supplies an additional support. The Ashmolean's earthenware must be derived from a porcelain version. Much detail has been lost. There is no longer any pattern on the girdle passing between Ariadne's breasts and she no longer wears a bracelet. The vase beside her has no handle and she is given no grapes to squeeze into it. There is no vine branch on the ground between her and Bacchus. Her face is also turned slightly up. The modelling is also generally much cruder.

34. Hercules and Iole
31.15 cms. (height); 26.7 cms. (length, from Iole's right arm's stump to the right hand of Hercules); 22.7 cms. (length of integral base); 15.1 cms. (width of integral base)
Earthenware of a pinky cream colour. The glaze is slightly green where gathered, crazed in a few areas (e.g. on the left knee of Hercules), and either worn or chipped off in numerous areas (e.g. on the right thigh of Hercules). The left foot of Hercules has been broken and repaired, three of the fingers of his left hand have been broken and are lost, his nose and upper lip have been broken off and are lost, the thumb of Iole's left hand has been broken off and is lost, her right arm has been broken at the wrist, and the hand is lost. There is a large chip missing from the base, back proper left (this is the only recent damage). There is a hole in the base beside the right foot of Hercules to secure his club held by Iole (now missing). The group was cast in four parts; the base (which is hollow below); the two figures (hollow only in the thickest parts); and the club (presumably solid), all of which would have been assembled before firing.
See No. 33 for provenance.
This group representing Hercules infatuated with Iole, having surrendered his club and lion skin to her and taking up her distaff (as described by Boccaccio and Tasso, adapting the ancient tale of Hercules and Omphale), seems to have been designed by Foggini as a bronze and several casts are known in this medium: some were exhibited by his sons; one was catalogued as his work in Düsseldorf in 1751; examples are known in several private collections; and one is in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 9-1956) for these see the entry for the latter version by J. Montagu in the catalogue of the exhibition The Twilight of the Medici (Gli ultimi Medici) (Detroit and Florence, 1974), 60-1, no. 24. There is also a terracotta version in the Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery, in which the right leg of Iole is not crossed behind that of Hercules, which might be a variant on the composition by Foggini, but is more probably by a follower.
A wax model was recorded in a late eighteenth-century inventory of the Doccia factory 'Gruppo d'Ercole e Jole. Del Foggini in cera con forma'-and the piece-mould survives in the factory's museum (K. Lankheit, Die Modellsammlung der Porzellanmanufaktur Doccia (Munich, 1982), 122). It was no doubt a version in porcelain which served as the model for this and other versions in earthenware. These differ from the bronze in that here the arm of Hercules is placed on his hip rather than being raised. The lion skin in the earthenware version also falls over Iole's shoulder, the drapery folds between the legs of Hercules are less deeply undercut, and there is no plant on the rock-work base.
A version of this group is illustrated by Giuseppe Morazzoni in his La terraglia italiana (Milan, n.d. [?1956], pl. 119), paired, as this is, with one of Bacchus and Ariadne, both in the collection of Cav. Eugenio Imbert in Milan (perhaps the pair today displayed in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan). Another version of the Bacchus and Ariadne in the same collection and also illustrated (pl. 116) seems to have been a companion with a Pan and Syrinx after the famous antique group (see F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique (London and New Haven, Conn., 1981), 286-8). Both the Hercules and Iole and two Bacchus and Ariadne groups illustrated in Morazzoni are certainly from the same factory as the Ashmolean's groups. This is identified by Morazzoni as the Manifattura Aldrovrandi in Bologna and the models are even attributed to Giacomo Rossi who is known to have managed the factory. No reasons are given, but tradition (which is presumably the basis for the attribution) must be treated with respect.
Count Filippo Aldrovandi-Marescotti opened the factory in 1794 in his palace in Contrada Galliera, Bologna: it was in full operation by 1798. The aim was to compete with English creamware which was being so successfully exported to Italy and the body consisted of 'terra di Vicenza bianchissima' together with pure white marble dust from Carrara and the glaze was made with 'litargirio d'Inghilterra', Italian flint, and sea salt (Morazzoni, op. cit. 109-15). The earthenware body of these groups is pale but is less fine than creamware.
There are many other factories in Italy at which these figures might have been produced-the Este factory from 1779 under the ownership of Girolamo Franchini (1728-1808) has been regarded as a likely place of origin-so too has the Ferniani factory at Faenza. A version of the group of Hercules and Iole was certainly made at Faenza but in a more careful model with numerous variations (the right leg of Hercules is drawn in, his left arm raised as in the bronzes-Iole's head is differently inclined, a lion's paw is tied across her breasts) and as a companion group with an entirely different interpretation of Bacchus and Ariadne. (The examples of these groups in the Villa Case Grandi in Faenza come from the factory's own collection-see the catalogue of the exhibition L'età neoclassica a Faenza (Palazzo Milzetti, Faenza, 1979), 242, nos. 533-4, pl. 398.) On the other hand examples of the Ashmolean groups also survive in Faenza's Museo Internazionale delle Ceramiche (inv. nos. 9859 and 9860- ibid. 243, nos. 538-9, unillustrated). Several large groups, one of a couple at an altar, another of Pan making unwelcome advances to a girl, and a third of Cupid and Psyche included in the Cini gift displayed (without labels) in Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome are very similar in modelling and colour and character of glaze to the Ashmolean groups and must be from the same factory.",,catalogue text,en

35. Group of furniture mounts: four scroll feet, four tendril volutes, and five plants
8.3 cms. (height of each foot); 16 cms. (length of each foot); 35.5 cms. (length of each tendril); 4.4 cms. (height of the largest, central plant); 19.8 cms. (length of the largest, central plant)
Bronze, fire-gilt. Each ornament is solid cast. All are partially textured with a punch. Two of the plants retain hand-wrought irregular- headed gilded nails.
The mounts are attached to the 'Fitzwilliam Coin Cabinet'. Purchased for the Heberden Coin Room from 'The Highly Important Collection of Roman Brass Coins and Medallions originally formed in the mid-eighteenth century' and sold by order of 'The Earl Fitzwilliam's Wentworth Estates Company' by Christie's at Spencer House 30 and 31 May 1949 in which it was the final lot, 501. According to tradition in the Coin Room the cabinet was purchased by the Keeper without previous plans, but copies of the catalogue mark it down to 'Spink' for £50. Whether the Keeper asked Spink's to bid shortly before the lot was auctioned, or bought it immediately afterwards from Spink's, is not clear. The cabinet of ebony with pietra dura pictures, friezes, and columns is presumed to have been acquired by the 2nd marquis of Rockingham (1730- 82) when he was still Lord Malton, perhaps when in Florence on the Grand Tour between his arrival there in early January 1748/9 and his departure for Siena in May 1749, or upon his return there around 1 September 1749, but cabinets of this type, a speciality of the grand ducal workshops in Florence, had been popular th British visitors to Italy for over a century.
The cabinet was not originally designed for coins and the substructure in ebonized wood decorated with ivory medallions (see Nos. 159-61) must have been added in the third quarter of the eighteenth century when it was converted for this purpose. The ormolu Venus on top (see No. 40) is also an addition but of what date is less certain. The cabinet if purchased by Rockingham may not have been acquired with conversion in mind. Although his passion for collecting coins was well established by 26 April 1750 when he wrote to his father from Rome that he had not been able to resist the 'temptation' of purchasing 'medalls', he is unlikely to have been bothered by storage problems at that moment. He continued to collect avidly long after he returned, boasting in 1774 that his 'collection of Great Brass is indeed acknowledged to be the finest in Europe in regard to the great number of rare heads and reverses, and also in regard to the high preservation they are in. I keep constantly upon the watch to pick up what I can in England, and having now been a collector for near 28 years and having always found great pleasure in the pursuit, I shall constantly continue it' (R. J. Hopper, 'The Second Marquis of Rockingham, Coin Collector', Antiquaries Journal, 62/2 (1982), 322).
This was not the only example of Florentine pietra dura work, nor the only elaborate cabinet, in Rockingham's possession. A 'curious cabinet' of tortoiseshell, ivory, and ebony is the work of art which receives most attention in the 'Description of Wentworth House' published in the Universal Magazine for October 1770 (169-70). In the inventory of 'Household Goods, Plate, Pictures' etc. made after Rockingham's death we find two entries which might correspond with the Ashmolean's cabinet: a 'Cabinet Curiously inlaid with different kinds of Stones and Ornamented with Glass Columns & containing 10 Drawers, upon a black frame' in the Green Drawing Room at Wentworth Woodhouse (p. 13', this part of the inventory dated 16 September 1782) and a 'Black Ebony Cabinet Beautifully inlaid with Marbles etc.' in a ground floor room of the family's house in Grosvenor Square, London (p. 51', this part dated 28 August 1782). An 'Italian casket with domed lifting top exterior decorated in pietra dure [sic] mosaic with sprays of fruit held by ribands on black marble and ebonised ground with ormolu corner mounts and borders chased with masks and foliage' was lot 27 in the sale at Christie's, London, on 15 July 1948 of 'Etruscan and Greek Vases and Fine English Furniture' from Wentworth Woodhouse. An 'Important Early 18th Century Italian Ebony Cabinet and stand... elaborately inlaid in lapis lazuli scaglia [sic] and coloured marbles with exotic birds and of flowers and fruit' was lot 293 in the sale of a 'large portion sprays of the contents of Wentworth Woodhouse' conducted at the house, 4-9 July 1949, by H. Spencer and Sons of Retford, Worksop, and Sheffield.
Some of the ormolu mounts on the coin cabinet-the four scroll and shell feet, the four tendril volutes, and the five loosely arranged plants on the cornice-are likely to be original, although it is hard to be sure since they have all been refixed. There are also some very inferior ornaments in mastic and wood such as the leaves above the keyhole escutcheon, and the drop below it. The keyhole escutcheon itself, which is the most remarkable of the ormolu mounts, is catalogued separately (No. 63). It may always have been fitted to this cabinet but it looks as if it might originally have been designed for another, earlier piece. The scrolled feet are very close in character to those on an ebony and pietra dura casket in a private collection which have been attributed to Foggini and, if enlarged, would be similar to those on the celebrated ebony and pietra dura prie-dieu in Palazzo Pitti which was made by A. Suster, G. A. Torricelli, and P. Molti to Foggini's designs in 1706 (A. González-Palacios, Il tempio del gusto (La Toscana e l'Italia settentrionale), 2 vols. (Milan, 1986), i. 43-4, 51, ii, pls. 88 and 135). The bronze tendrils are very similar to those projected in about 1705 for the urn of S. Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi in a drawing made by Foggini now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and they may also be related to some of the ornaments on a sumptuous pietra dura table presented to the king of Denmark in 1709, now in Rosenberg Castle, Copenhagen (ibid. i, pl. xii, ii, pl. 124). Whereas it could be argued that the feet are merely in the style of the late seventeenth century in Italy, tendrils of this sort seem to be an original invention of Foggini's",,catalogue text,en

36. Angel supporting a horn- shaped candle-holder
52.8 cms. (height including base); 2.1 cms. (height of base); 13.5 cms. (diameter of base)
Bronze with oil gilding, extensively worn to reveal a slightly olive tan coloured natural patina. There is evidence of extensive chiselling. The figure is hollow, and presumably a lost-wax cast. The wings are solid cast and riveted to the back-solder now reinforces a join which must originally have been neater. The chiselling of the feathers passes over the join. The upper portion of the horn has been cast separately and soldered. There is a hole between the wings in the figure's back. 'A[D] GAI 1749' is chiselled with angular strokes on the side of the integral base behind the figure at proper left: the cross bar of the 'A' is in the form of a 'v' and the top of the '9' is squared. This is preceded by a diagrammatic chalice, also chiselled.
Purchased in late January 1960 from Herbert N. Bier of 2 Strathearn Place, Hyde Park Square, London W2, for £900, from the France Fund with the assistance of a grant from the National Art-Collections Fund. Registered 15 December 1960. 'In recent times' it had belonged to 'an American Collector'.
The angel must have been companion to another in a complementary pose, as Parker noted when publishing the bronze in the Annual Report for 1960 (p. 65); indeed it probably belonged originally to a set of four, not least because it is very similar in character to the four standing angels (over 4 ft high) also with horn-shaped candle-holders which Tiziano Aspetti was commissioned to make in the autumn of 1593 by the Congregazione dell'Arca for the altar of St Anthony, in S. Antonio, Padua (see A. Sartori, Documenti per la storia dell'arte a Padova (Vicenza, 1976), 11-12). Gai may well have been asked to take these famous angels as his models: if so he was not averse to imitating details as well as the general appearance of Aspetti's work: the belts and drapery borders of Aspetti's angels, and of the four Virtues he created for the altar rail of the same church, reappear in Gai's work.
What must be either the companion or, more probably, one of three companions for the Ashmolean's angel was exhibited at the Heim Gallery, September 1984 (as no. 31), and belongs to the London art dealer Daniel Katz. It has a black varnish much worn to expose a brassy metal like that of the Ashmolean's bronze, with traces of gilding, and the name, date, and device chiselled in the same style on the side of the base. Since the right foot of Mr Katz's angel is advanced and his head turned to his left he must have been placed on the other side of the altar to the Ashmolean's angel, but since his hands are joined in prayer it seems likely that he was matched by another in an equivalent attitude. Beside Mr Katz's angel there was perhaps one with his left hand to the breast in adoration, more or less a mirror image of the Ashmolean's.
The workmanship and material of these angels by Gai is characteristic of other Venetian eighteenth-century bronzes; the same brassy colour and extensive chiselling is found, for example, in similarly sized figures by Francesco Bertos (active) 1693-1734) of SS Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola--lot 118 at Christie's, London, 3 July 1985. Gai, who was (according to Tomaso Temanza, Zibaldon, ed. N. Ivanoff [Civilità veneziana: Fonti e testi, 6, 1st series 3] (n.d., [1963]), 29) apprenticed to a wood carver, is recorded as executing numerous works in wood, stone, and marble all over the Veneto (see the list compiled by Camillo Semenzato in La scultura veneta del seicento e del settecento (Venice, 1966), 131-2), but only one commission for a bronze is documented. This was for the gates of the Loggetta of the Campanile of Piazza San Marco in Venice upon which we read 'ANT. GAI ET FILII. VEN. INV. FUS. & CAELAR MDCCXXXIV.', which is an unusually explicit statement of total responsibility for modelling, casting, and tooling. There can be little doubt that Gai (or his sons Francesco and Giovanni) had considerable experience in this medium; he could not otherwise have been awarded such an important commission. And yet the two altar angels described above are the only other two works in bronze that can be associated with him.
These angels may (as suggested above) have been commissioned as small variants on Aspetti's, and the the Loggetta obviously had to be in a style congruous with the sculpture and architecture of Sansovino, but Gai was in any case inclined to revive a sixteenth-century style in reaction to the followers of Bernini. He consistently avoided bustling drapery, deep shadows, broken outlines, and dynamic torsion in his figures. In this conservatism Gai was doubtless encouraged by the most important arbiter of taste then resident in Venice, Consul Smith, whose patronage he enjoyed and who was responsible for sending some of his works to Britain--'Atalanta', 'Meleagro', and 'Senatori antichi' are cited in a contemporary source (Temanza, op. cit. 31).
A Meleager in marble, 143 cms. high, and dated 1735, was sold at Sotheby's, London, 22 April 1986, lot 48 (the vendor was anonymous, but the sculpture was included in a photograph of private rooms at Castle Howard published in the World of Interiors magazine). This figure is very close to the Ashmolean's angel especially in the flattened and straight- lined folds of drapery but also in the manner in which the figure's left hand is caught in the drapery and the foot projects beyond the circular base. The Swedish diplomat and collector Nicholas Tessin noted that no sculptor in Italy was more highly esteemed than 'le grand Gai', this 'demi Michel-Ange', 'si fort gâté par les Anglais qu'il demande et obtient 80 seguins pour la moindre petite Statue' (O. Sirén, Dessins et tableaux de la Renaissance italienne dans les collections de Suède (Stockholm, 1902), 109). A much damaged statue by Gai, rescued from an English country house park, survives in a private garden in Oxford.",,catalogue text,en

43.4 cms. (height); 27.5 cms. (length)
Terracotta of a pale beige colour. There are traces of some dark colour on the ground and many traces of gilding, for instance on the figure's right breast, on the lion's right ear, and in the follicles above his upper lip. There are also traces of gesso, most obvious under the figure's right forearm, which was presumably a preparation for the gilding. Several of the straps over the biceps of the figure's left arm are missing and there has been a small loss to the lion's right car. The group was modelled in two parts and joined before firing, doubtless in order to facilitate the hollowing of the clay. The base, lion, and draped legs were modelled together with the figure's left hand and a portion of drapery. The join across the figure's right wrist and the drapery in her left hand is apparent and there is a small aperture where the belly meets the front fold of drapery.
The group is first mentioned in a letter of 7 March 1960 from the dealer David Carritt to Sir Karl Parker: 'I have just bought something which would amuse you very much: a terracotta group representing Bologna as a lady sitting on a lion, the work of Gaetano Gandolfi. I shall send you some photographs.' A letter enclosing these and giving the price of £275 was dated two days later. The sculpture was bought with the assistance of the Regional Fund administered by the Victoria and Albert Museum and registered on 4 June 1960.
The terracotta is likely to be a modello for a larger sculpture in stucco or marble which has not been identified (it may never have been executed or may have been destroyed). It is designed to be seen from several points of view and is compelling but somewhat simplified from behind which suggests a position on the canted podium at the corner of a free-standing, or a boldly projecting, monument.
The sculpture was attributed to Ubaldo Gandolfi by K. T. Parker in the Annual Report (1960: 66) 'both on stylistic and circumstantial evidence'. The 'circumstantial evidence' would appear from a note in the Register to have been the dealer's claim that it was acquired from a descendant of Gandolfi in Bologna-presumably there was a tradition that it had been made by a member of the family. No details of this transaction, of the family's history, or of their heirlooms generally are given in the correspondence with David Carritt, whose nose for concealed treasures and deftness at extracting them, was, however, proverbial and who is unlikely to have invented the story. Both Ubaldo (1728-81) and Gaetano (1734-1802) Gandolfi, leading painters and engravers in Bologna in the second half of the eighteenth century, are known to have made clay models as part of the preparation of their paintings, Gaetano is documented as the author of the competition reliefs in terracotta which survive in the Accademia Clementina in Bologna. There is no proof that he was given sculptural commissions later in his career but various terracottas have been attributed to him, including the remarkable polychrome Lamentation group in the sanctuary of the Madonna di S. Luca in Bologna of the 1780s. Ubaldo is documented as having designed the large statue of Diana in the garden of Casa Savioli in 1773 (also partially executed by him but with much assistance from Giovanni Lipparini) and as having modelled in 1780 the imposing stucco figures of Isaiah and Jeremiah for the new church of S. Giuliano in Bologna. (R. Roli, 'Aggiunte e precisazioni sui Gandolfi plasticatori', Il Carobbio (1976); E. Riccòmini, Vaghezza e furore: La scultura del settecento in Emilia e Romagna (Bologna, 1977), 123-4). Ubaldo's declamatory stucco prophets (Riccòmini, op. cit., 201-2) differ greatly in style from the Ashmolean terracotta. Gaetano's documented reliefs are closer, although they present no obvious similarities, and, if we accept the 'circumstantial' evidence pointing to authorship by one of them, then Gaetano (Carritt's candidate) must be preferred to Ubaldo. If all that was known of the Ashmolean terracotta was that it came from Emilia- Romagna one would perhaps be inclined to attribute it to Antonio Trentanove (b. c.1740, d. 1812) in whose work one can find the same broad heavy drapery treated with an easy fluency. The lion which he modelled for his St Mark in S. Lucia, Forlì, also has the same comic face as the one here (Riccòmini, op. cit., pl. 119).
A sample was taken by Mrs Doreen Stoneham of the Oxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art in March 1987 and thermo-luminiscence tests suggested that it had been fired between 1727 and 1827 (ref. 381-z-94).",,catalogue text,en

38. Emperor Charles V
22 cms. (height including socle); 5.5 cms. (height of socle); 5.8 cms. (length and width of plinth of socle)
Bronze with a dark chestnut brown patina worn to a paler brown in some salient or smooth areas. Hollow, lost-wax, cast. Traces of plaster core (and animal hair bonding) in interior, and a line of flashing inside the neck. The turned portion of the socle with its plinth are separately cast and soldered to the projection below the chest. '500' is chiselled in the interior of the socle. 'OPRIETÀ ARTISTICA' (for 'Proprietà artistica') is incised in the model across the side of the plinth of the socle at the back and 'GEMITO' is incised in the model on the back of the projection below the chest. A minute foundry stamp in the metal to the edge of the chest to proper left: 'FONDERIA/GEMITO/NAPOLI' has slipped to read 'FOND/GEMERIA/NAPITO /...I'
Purchased on 6 October 1987 from Anthony Roth Fine Arts Ltd, 49 Maddox Street, London, for £6,000, with the fund established by Dame Helen Gardner.
A life-size full-length statue of the Emperor Charles V was commissioned from Gemito by King Umberto I in 1886 for the façade of the Palazzo Reale in Naples as one of a series of eight statues of the city's illustrious rulers (or at least eminent viceroys). The commission, together with another for a silver centrepiece, precipitated a mental collapse in the artist who was admitted in 1887 to an asylum from which he immediately fled. The statue had to be completed by another sculptor using Gemito's design. Gemito's original wax model for the statue is in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan (L. Caramel and C. Pirovano, Galleria d'Arte Moderna: Opera dell'ottocento F.-M. (Milan, 1975), no. 1032, pl. 1030). This bronze may be an abbreviation of such a preliminary sketch.  In any case it is possibly identical with the 'esquisse de Charles V', a bronze exhibited by Gemito at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris where his lost-wax casts, of which this is a superlative example, had been enormously admired since the success of his Neopolitan Fisherboy at the Salon of 1878 and his portrait of Meissonier completed in 1879. Gemito had established his own foundry by 1883-'geloso di Cellini', as he informed Meissonier (S. di Giacomo, La vita e l'opera di Vincenzo Gemito (Naples, 1905), 121)-but how active this was, and indeed how active Gemito was, during the period of about twenty years after he fled from the asylum and became a recluse is not clear, nor are the exact degree and duration of his mental illness (see the admirable review of the conflicting evidence by P, Fusco in 'Medusa as a Muse for Vincenzo Gemito (1852-1929)', J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, 16 (1988), 127-8 n. 6). We have no record of other casts of this bust, but it is unlikely to be unique. A bronze statuette of the whole length figure is in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples (IC 4110).

39. Woman at the bath
33.2 cms. (height including integral base)
Bronze with a natural patina of olive green and pale tan with vestiges of blackened varnish. A few traces of plaster in the hollows. The interior blocked with wax. No obvious evidence of tooling. 'B.420 ' is painted in white on upper surface of base behind the foot. Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed by him in 1899. B. 420 in his catalogues. For the circumstances of its display when in his collection see Nos. 112-15. It was then placed upon a shaft of green fossil marble for which see the bust of Henri IV (No. 299). Purchased in Rome 'about 1853' according to both the large, and the notebook, catalogues, but 'bt. Rome 1851' according to the preliminary catalogue compiled in 1856 (38), and possibly identical with the 'Venus XVc' purchased by him before 1851, together with a Spinario and the miniature version of Michelangelo's Pietà (No. 60), according to his manuscript 'memoranda of prices paid'.
Fortnum described this a few years after he had purchased it as 'Venus stepping from a Bath after the marble in the Villa Ludovisi known as the Venus of M. angelo' (preliminary notebook catalogue, 38), but he considered that it was 'in the style of Giovanni da Bologna'. A bronze statuette (24.8 cms. high) of this same figure with the artist's name, 'IOANNES BOLOGNA BELGA', chiselled on its base, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (no. 5874), has been plausibly, but not certainly, identified as the Venus by Giambologna presented to the Emperor Maximilian II by the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. If so, however, he returned to the theme when he carved the nearly life-size marble now in the American Embassy in Rome (the Ludovisi Venus to which Fortnum alludes) for Giovanni Giorgio Cesarini in 1583 (C. Avery, Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 107, pl. 101). There are numerous bronze versions of this figure, all of them larger in size than the signed one in Vienna, but differing only in minor details-the treatment of the fringe of the drapery by the feet and of the coiled hair, for instance. Many of these are very close to the version in the Ashmolean Museum, not only in size and details, but in finish (there being little evidence of tooling in the metal, as Fortnum observed). Some were being made in Florence by the early seventeenth century and one was among the group of statuettes presented in 1611 by the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici to Henry, prince of Wales (K. Watson and C. Avery, 'Medici and Stuart: A Grand Ducal Gift of ""Giovanni Bologna"" Bronzes for Henry Prince of Wales (1612)', Burlington Magazine, 115 (1973), 493-512). It was described in the inventories of King Charles I as 'a stoopeing standing woeman upon one leg... her left hand on her left nipple' (ibid. 506).
A list of bronzes of this type is given by William Wixom in his Renaissance Bronzes from Ohio Collections (Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, 1975), under no. 148. This list, however, includes variants in which the drapery consists of one continuous piece of cloth. There are fine versions of this variant, among them that on loan to Cleveland Muscum from the Bishop family (ibid., no. 148), as well as very poor nineteenth-century sand-casts (see for example the example in the reserve collection of the Fogg Museum, Cambridge, Mass., 1937-13). It cannot be proved that this variant was invented by Giambologna. It relates to another figure of a nude woman at the bath attributed to him, which is known in statuettes of a smaller size, among them another in Ohio (ibid., no. 149) and the gilt bronze in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Brunswick, which was one of the most exquisite objects in the Giambologna exhibition of 1978 (C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 64, no. 5). In this latter variant the goddess's left foot is also on a step and a length of drapery is raised to her left breast in her left hand, but her right arm is drawn across her body and her head is turned to her right shoulder. This pose would seem to derive from the sculptor's group of Florence Victorious over Pisa (of 1565-70) but with the female nude reversed and deprived of an abject enemy. Its complex, continuously winding rhythm has an irresistible appeal, but as narrative the other versions are more enticing providing a glimpse of beauty, intimately occupied, unconscious of our admiration. Narrative is reintroduced into the sinuous variant, however, by the addition of an infant whose squalling supplies the pretext for her turned head (as in the bronze in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich-Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit. 66, no. 9).
It is clear that elegant variations on these bronze statuettes were being devised by other sculptors within Giambologna's own lifetime, among them the 'L.P.' whose initials appear, with the date 1579, on the exquisite boxwood statuette in the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt on Main (St. 12, Oskar und Ilse Mulert-Stiftung). A reduced variant with continuous drapery was modified to form a companion for an equally free variant on the antique Callipygian Venus (see Die Bronzen der fürstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein (Liebieghaus, Frankfurt on Main, 1987), 166–7, nos. 10 and 11).
Among versions close to the bronze in the Ashmolean Museum are the following: Wallace Collection, London (S. 110), Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, Missouri (31- 54-not listed by Wixom), Poldi Pezzoli Museum, Milan (Piccolo Museo Mario e Fosca Crespi, FC. 24/68), Fairhaven Collection, The National Trust, Anglesey Abbey, Cambridgeshire (Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit. 63, no. 2, not listed by Wixom), Menil Foundation, Houston, Texas (ibid. 63, no. 3, listed by Wixom as with Michael Hall Fine Art Inc.), Berlin-Dahlem, Staatliche Museum, inv. 1966 (W. Bode, Bildwerke des Kaiser-Friedrick Museums, ii: Bronzestatuetten, Busten und Gebrauchsgegenstände (Berlin and Leipzig, 1930), no. 156, pl. 50).

41. Hercules and the Erymanthian Boar
45 cms. (height to boar's back left trotter); 43.7 cms. (height to boar's front right trotter); 10.2 cms. (height of plinth); 24.2 cms. (length of plinth); 20.2 cms. (width of plinth)
Bronze with a deep russet-gold varnish largely blackened, partially worn and scratched to reveal a natural pale tan patina. Hollow, probably lost-wax, cast. There is much tooling: in particular, the club is covered with punched marks in an undulating pattern. The figure is bolted to a mahogany plinth, toned and varnished to match the bronze. Rough platforms below the feet are just visible where they are attached to the plinth.
Presented in memory of Otto Gutekunst by his widow in 1953. Registered on 15 July. The bronze had been bought in at Christie's, London, 25 June 1953, where it was lot 11 (already with its present plinth).
The group, representing the fourth labour of Hercules, was cast in silver from a model by Giambologna, as one of a series of six groups commissioned by the Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici for the Tribuna in the Uffizi. The casting of this group by Michele Mazzafirri took place in 1589, but the model might have been made some years previously, for work began on the commission in 1576. The earliest bronze version to be documented is the example in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (5846), which is recorded in the inventory of the Kunstkammer of the Emperor Rudolf II compiled between 1607 and 1611 (see C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 122-3, for the series generally, and 126, no. 79 for this model; see also C. Avery, Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 141-5, for the series). The version in Vienna is the only one in which the hair of the hero is bound with a fillet; it is also of higher quality than any other.
Far more bronze versions of this group exist than of any of the other groups originally in the Tribuna: it is hard to believe that this reflects especial esteem for the model, which possesses rather less of either grace or drama than many of the others. The Annual Report for 1953 mentions that six other versions are recorded. This is an underestimate. W. Bode illustrated one in his Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), iii, pl. CXCVII (private collection, Milan); another was illustrated by Planiscig in his Piccoli bronzi italiani del Rinascimento (Milan, 1930), pl. XI, no. 17; one was sold with the Castiglioni Collection in Vienna on 25 November 1925. There are versions in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples (10785; Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit. 125, no. 78); the Metropolitan Museum, New York (1982-60-100, published by J. D. Draper in The Jack and Belle Linsky Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, 1984), 154, no. 69); the National Gallery of Art, Washington (1942-9-121); the Museo del Castello Sforzesco, Milan; the Museo Nazionale of the Bargello, Florence; the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore (54.679); the Wallace Collection, London (S. 125).
With the exception of the version in Naples which is a reproduction made in the late nineteenth century and that at Baltimore which has exceptionally precise tooling and is attached to an irregular-shaped bronze base, all these museum versions resemble each other very closely. Details of modelling (for example, the treatment of veins on the hero's left hand) and finishing (for example, the punching on the bark of the club) are identical and the only obvious differences are the curls of the boar's tail, which is easily bent out of place, and in the colour of the bronze, which, however, always shows evidence of an original warm varnish. These versions are generally catalogued as Florentine and seventeenth century, but in no case is there a provenance to prove that they were made before the last century. They do resemble very closely a version, one of a set of four of these Labours, from Wentworth Woodhouse, sold at Christie's, London, 15 July 1986, lot 47, and catalogued as likely to have been one of the bronzes by Giambologna acquired by Lord Malton (later 2nd marquis of Rockingham) in Florence in the late 1740s (see his letter to his father of 1 September 1749, Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments, M2). However, the very careful and full inventories of Rockingham's collection do not list the group. A version of the bronze which also closely resembled the casts under discussion was sold at Sotheby's, London, 11 December 1986, lot 72. It was possible to examine this closely, and it turned out to be a sand-cast assembled out of four elements (the boar together with the hero's left arm; the club; the hero's right arm; the hero's torso and legs) in a manner typical of Parisian foundries in the last century. The nature of the varnish would make the joins hard to detect in many of the examples cited above.",,catalogue text,en

42. Candlestand in the form of Mercury flying
24.8 cms. (height); 1.3 cms. (height of marble base)
The body of Mercury is of bronze with a green varnish worn to expose a natural brown patina where handled on the legs. Hollow, presumably lost-wax, cast. Helmet, the two wings attached to it, the wings attached to the ankles, and the head of the wind god, all of bronze fire-gilt, and each separately cast and attached. The band across the chest and loop of flying drapery of pliable metal (probably copper) fire-gilt. Mounted on a base in the form of a disc of white Carrara marble.
Purchased from the dealer David Carritt in 1960 for £75. The transaction took place around 7 March when Carritt wrote to assure Parker of his confidence that the gilt accessories were original. Registered 5 May 1960.
Giambologna was commissioned by the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in the second half of 1564 to execute a flying Mercury the size of a 'fanciullo di 15 anni' as one of several diplomatic presents for the Emperor Maximillian II. Large and small versions were made over the next twenty years, status and dating of which are much debated (a variety of opinions may be extracted from C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 83-8, nos. 33-5). The figure was much copied throughout subsequent centuries. By the late eighteenth century it was adapted to carry candles. Among the sketches and reports from Rome sent by Charles Heathcote Tatham to the architect Henry Holland in 1795 are two designs for candelabra by Giuseppe Boschi (see No. 15), one of which is a 'Mercury of Florence' in fact Giambologna's famous figure-balanced on a ball of 'oriental alabaster' placed upon a circular pedestal of 'red porphyry' with 'bronze mouldings gilt in french gold'. There is a short branch in his raised right hand and a larger one in his left. As a pair Boschi proposed 'the celebrated Antique fame in the Collection of the Empress of Russia' with the candles arising from the basket she holds aloft. Each was 2 feet 10 inches high including pedestals and the pair was priced at $250 Roman scudis equal to ab'. £58 English'. A pair of Mercurys but slightly larger, with different pedestals and supporting several branches of Empire design, is to be found in the Royal Palace, Madrid. The Ashmolean's bronze is inferior in execution and design. The folds of the drapery are simply pressed ridges. The little wings look stuck on to the helmet and ankles with no idea of growing from them, the features of the face are inarticulate, the extremities are inexpressive, and there is no life in the modelling of the torso, even below the crude varnish. It may well be English and of about 1800 as Parker suggested (Annual Report (1960), 66) and if so perhaps a poor imitation of a bronze by Boschi.",,catalogue text,en

Bronze with a pale tan natural patina rubbed to a brassy yellow on salient points. Hollow, lost-wax, cast. Mounted on a block of serpentine. Inscribed in black ink '1460.1888'.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 19 August 1887, given in 1888. B. 416 in his catalogues. 'Bought at Geneva' according to his notebook catalogue, presumably after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not included, was compiled. Fortnum noted that the bronze was gilt. C. F. Bell added a note that this was paint (perhaps gilding on a gesso coating) which he had cleaned off in 1902.
Among the group of bronzes sent from the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici as a diplomatic present to Henry prince of Wales in 1611 was 'uno Pastore che suona la piva' (K. Watson and C. Avery, 'Medici and Stuart: A Grand Ducal Gift of ""Giovanni Bologna"" Bronzes for Henry Prince of Wales (1612)', Burlington Magazine, 115 (1973), 505). Statuettes of the type in the Ashmolean have been plausibly associated with this 'pastore'. They must be related to another only slightly less common statuette of a rural figure, a peasant or shepherd leaning cross-legged on a staff. Next on the list of bronzes sent to England in 1611 was 'uno Pastore che s'appoggia a uno bastone'. These two figures are also found together as a pair in the Museo di Palazzo Venezia, Rome (Collezione Auriti, Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Rome, 1964), pls. 37 and 38; at present displayed in the fifth case to the right of the second room of bronzes), and look much as if they were designed together--the standing figure listening to the seated performer. A 'Villano' described as leaning on a staff and a 'pastore' appear together on a list (discovered in the Florentine archives by James Holderbaum) of silver statuettes, evidently recently made, which were loaned in 1601 from the Galleria of the grand duke to Antonio Susini, Giambologna's most talented Florentine pupil, presumably so that further versions of them could be cast. The models of these silver figures are likely to have been by Giambologna: in any case we know from the inventory of Benedetto Gondi's collection in Florence in 1609 that Giambologna made at least one Pastorino (C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 164-5, nos. 135-7).
Statuettes of the seated bagpiper fall into two categories. There are rough casts, such as the Ashmolean's, all with minor variations and often with losses (thus, the example in the Wernher Collection at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire (no. 476), has no mouthpiece, and the horn is lost below the figure's left hand, the head is fitted further back, and the hat is of slightly different shape). The most familiar and least crude of these rough casts was the one published by Bode (Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance (London, 1907-12), ii, CCV), today in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin-Dahlem (2242, in reserve, see Ex aere solido: Bronzen von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. Eine Ausstellung der Stiftung preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin (Berlin, 1983), 148, no. 79, entry by M.-T. Suermann). It has a certain amount of texturing on bag, trunk, and drapery. Of far finer finish, and plausibly associated with the workshop of Antonio Susini, are the statuettes, of approximately identical size, in Palazzo Venezia (already mentioned), in the Bargello (no. 464, formerly in the Uffizi, gilt), in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 59- 1956), in the Fitzwilliam Museum (M. 2-1961), and in the Liechtenstein Collection (formerly Bardini Collection; Die Bronzen der fürstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein (Liebieghaus, Frankfurt, 1987, no. 22) and lot 83, Sotheby's, London, 10 April 1975. Of these the Fitzwilliam version has most detailing (stops in the pipe, texture on the sack, fringes to the clothes) and it, together with the Sotheby's 1975 version, includes a feather in the hat which is reproduced in some of the rougher versions.
The rougher versions are not merely inferior derivatives but have considerable character. Their authorship was not discussed in the Giambologna exhibition catalogue (Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit. above). They resemble the bronzes by Fanelli (see Nos. 491, 492), who might have had access either to the version in the English Royal Collection or to one in his native Florence. His work on this scale has the same roughness, his casts are of very similar weight, and his metal is often close in colour.
Fortnum in his notebook catalogue observed simply that the bronze was 'Italian XVIth Century'. In his large catalogue he wrote, 'This doubtless represents one of the ""pifferari"" (of the period) who still make their music at Roman and other shrines at ""natale"" and may probably be of Roman workmanship'. C. F. Bell, annotating this, noted the superior quality of the Liechtenstein version and also that Bode had proposed a connection with Giambologna, speculating, because of their 'Netherlandish character' that they were early works by him (Renaissance Bronzes in the Pierpont Morgan Collection (London, 1908), p. xxii). There may well have been a tradition of small statuettes of low-life subjects north of the Alps before there was one in Italy. A boxwood figure of a player standing with crossed legs attributed to the Nuremberg school and dated c.1600 in the Cleveland Museum of Art may be representative of such a tradition. This figure is derived from a print by Dürer and Charles Avery has suggested that Dürer's prints were an inspiration for Giambologna as well (Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 47, pls. 35 and 36).",,catalogue text,en

Bronze with a uniform dark brown-green patina. Hollow, lost-wax, cast. Tiny firing crack on the front standing leg. Tooled with great precision and highly polished. Fixed to a base of ebonized wood.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum in October 1894 and bequeathed 1899. No. 445 in his catalogues. No date of acquisition recorded but presumably after 1857 when the preliminary catalogue, in which it is not recorded, was compiled.
A very similar horse, with the same action, saddle-cloth, and cropped mane and tail dressing, but somewhat larger (42 cms. in length), is included in the bronze relief of the Grand Duke Cosimo I's triumphant entry into Siena on the base of the statue of him by Giambologna erected in 1599 in the Piazza della Signoria, Florence. The horse in the colossal group which this base supports (cast 1592-3) is of a similar, but less neat, character, as Fortnum noted (although he missed the much closer connection with the horse in the relief). It has been conjectured that the model for the small bronze may have originated as an idea for the colossal horse which, when rejected, was retained in the relief and then cast separately as a statuette. The invention is, in any case, clearly associated with Giambologna or at least with his workshop.
A cast such as this is a good example of the extraordinary quality of the work produced by members of that workshop, and in particular by Antonio Susini, in the decade or so following Giambologna's death. Other versions exist in the Bargello, Florence (golden red varnish, with an original oval bronze base), the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (dark red-gold varnish), and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown (dark patina similar to the Ashmolean's bronze, with a coat of arms engraved on the saddle-cloth). These three casts were exhibited together in the exhibition Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1978 (nos. 155, 156, 157). The compilers of that catalogue cite other versions in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm; the Museo Arqueológico Nacional, Madrid; the Art Institute, Chicago, but not this example nor those in the Museum and Art Gallery, Kelvingrove, Glasgow (SMT 107) and in the Faringdon Collection at Buscot Park, Oxfordshire. Inferior later casts with minor variations (for instance in the tail and top knot) are also known (one was lot 114, Christie's, London, 5 December 1989).
Fortnum observed of this 'highly finished & well modelled figure' that it was 'perhaps French, & by P. Dupetit circa 1768'. This was due to a similarity with a bronze at Windsor: however Fortnum's own notes on this subject reveal an uncharacteristic carelessness. Among his books preserved by the library of the Department of Western Art is a photographic album of the bronzes in the Royal Collection at Windsor. Accompanying this is a memorandum dated 21 May 1875, from which we see that Fortnum noted of one of the bronze horses in a corridor 'Horse same model, differing in details from mine'. This is in fact a statuette of the horse ridden by Cosimo on the monument itself. After it Fortnum wrote, 'signed on base P' DUPETIT. 1768'. But, as someone, perhaps Fortnum himself, subsequently observed, this name was in fact chiselled on the base of a similiar neighbouring equestrian statuette-as can indeed clearly be seen in the photographic album—and the memorandum is corrected by an arrow. The error reveals Fortnum's open mind about dating and also draws attention to the similar taste for a satin finish and precision detailing which prevailed in Paris in 1760 and Florence in 1610. It is not in fact at all unlikely that some of the bronze equestrian statuettes after Giambologna were cast in France in the eighteenth century. Having made this connection Fortnum seems to have retreated from it and he added 'if not from the atelier of Giovanni Bologna' in the large catalogue. The bronze is not likely to have had this uniform dark patina originally.",,catalogue text,en

12.5 cms. (height including integral plinth); 4.45 cms. (length of integral plinth); 3.3 cms. (width of integral plinth); 6 cms. (height of porphyry base); 7.8 cms. (length of porphyry base); 6.5 cms. (width of porphyry base)
Bronze with a palc, slightly olive, tan natural patina and considerable remains of a ruddy gold varnish (well preserved on Venus' proper right thigh and on the neck of Cupid). Hollow, lost-wax, cast. There are many casting flaws: the plinth is of uneven thickness and of an irregular shape with an untidy aperture below the tripod stool; the end of part of the drapery beside Cupid has been broken off; there is a crack at the contact of Venus' thigh with the drapery. There is much evidence of filing. A rectangular patch in Venus' left buttock may be discerned in a good light. 'B. /426. /' is painted in white on the scroll foot of the stool behind the figures. The group is mounted on a block of porphyry with a moulded plinth of ebonized wood.
Lent by C. D. E. Fortnum on 20 March 1888 and given later in the same year. B. 426 in his catalogues. 'Bought 1867', according to the large catalogue-in Florence for £4 from the dealer 'Dr Foresi' (for whom see the introduction), according to his notebook catalogue. Fortnum had the bronze mounted on a yellow marble base. C. F. Bell exchanged this for the porphyry base as he noted in pencil in Fortnum's large catalogue.
Fortnum described this bronze in his notebook catalogue as 'an elongated figure with a mannered grace after the manner of Gian Bologna', and in his large catalogue as 'an elongated figure with a mannered grace characteristic of the later period of John of Bologna's followers or fabrique'. According to an annotation in Fortnum's larger catalogue, Bode regarded it as by Giambologna himself, but most scholars today would prefer Fortnum's more cautious formulation. The pose of Venus certainly seems to depend upon some of Giambologna's inventions involving women with raised knees (most notably the marble Florence Triumphant over Pisa of about 1570 in the Bargello, Florence) and the pose of the Cupid is strongly reminiscent of the continuous spiral that Giambologna devised for the Apollo in the Studiolo, although it also recalls inventions of Michelangelo and Raphael. The group may be associated with several other small bronzes of nude women in elegant attitudes ostensibly prompted by the activities of the toilet: above all, the Venus standing on one foot unfastening her sandal (Ca d'Oro, Venice, D. br. 60) who has a very similar hair dressing and is the same size; also the nymph cutting her nails (No. 326).
The finest surviving example of this group of Venus and Cupid is certainly that in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (32.100.183; C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 67, no. 10), which is more detailed and more cleanly finished than the Ashmolean group, with a similar, but better preserved, ruddy gold varnish.
Among Giambologna's followers Antonio Susini seems l to be responsible for this group. Anthony Radcliffe has pointed out the similarity between the Cupid in the New York version and the Child in the larger group of the Virgin and Child in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, which seems to correspond to a group documented as an original work by this sculptor (ibid.). It is noteworthy that the type of stool that Venus rests her foot upon is much the same as that upon which David sits in the group signed by another member of the Susini family, Giovanni Francesco (Die Bronzen der fürstlichen Sammlung Liechtenstein (Liebieghaus, Frankfurt, 1987), 196-7, no. 30).
The Ashmolean's bronze must be supposed to be a later cast, having much the same relation to the New York version as the Ashmolean's little bagpiper (No. 44) has to the neater casts of that figure. It should, however, be distinguished from other much rougher casts of the some group in which there is a small mound under the feet of the stool, the scrolled feet of the stool are different, and the aperture between Cupid's bent left and straight right leg is smaller or non-existent. These tend to be a little larger in size (usually 13.7 cms. high): examples are in the Victoria and Albert Museum (A. 150- 1910), the Museo Schifanoia, Ferrara (R. Varese, Placchette e bronzi nelle Civiche Collezioni (Ferrara, 1975), 144, no. 132), and the collection of Sir Brinsley Ford (where there is also a version in red wax); one such was also recently for sale in London (lot 75, Sotheby's, London, 20 April 1989).
In addition there are versions of the Venus without the Cupid in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon (see Avery and Radcliffe, op. cit., no. 8), the Staatliche Museen, Berlin- Dahlem (1967), and the Liebieghaus, Frankfurt (St. P. 378). Of these the Dijon version is of a quality comparable with the New York group.
The composition seems to have been familiar all over Europe by the early seventeenth century and was employed by the Dutch goldsmith Thomas Bogaert as the supporter of one of a pair of silver gilt salts made in Utrecht in 1624 (Sotheby's, Geneva, 14 November 1988, lot 18). An ivory version of the group considered to be Italian and of the second half of the seventeenth century is in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum (R. 4732).",,catalogue text,en

13.5 cms. (height)
Wax covered with discoloured paint, flaking to reveal a battered surface. Chips at the lips reveal the original red of the wax. There are cracks in the bust across the proper left side. The bust is crudely reinforced with plaster of Paris in the hollow behind. On the pine base is an old paper label inscribed 'B FAC/ A. G. B. Russell'-from an exhibition at the Burlington Fine Arts Club. Another larger and older one inscribed in ink in an Italian hand, perhaps of the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, 'modello originale di Gio Bologna Cos..... Primo' is pasted on the front face.
Bequeathed by A. G. B. Russell KCVO, JP, Clarenceux King of Arms, who died in 1956. No. 19 on the receipt of works in the bequest collected from Mrs Stedall on 8 October 1958. Acquired by Russell before 1913 when exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.
The old label on the bust would seem to suggest that the Grand Duke Cosimo I was believed to be the subject. This might be a mistake from an earlier label describing Giambologna as Cosimo's court sculptor. E. Dhanens Jean Boulogne (Brussels, 1956), 108-9) accepted that Cosimo was the sitter and supposed that the cross hanging on his chest was that of the Order of S. Stefano, founded by Cosimo in 1561 with himself as Grand Master. H. Keutner, reviewing Dhanens (Kunstchronik, II (1958), 326), pointed out that the Cross is not the Maltese Cross of that order, but the Cross worn by the Knights of Christ, an order to which Giambologna was admitted in 1599, and remarked justly that the person depicted resembled Giambologna in the drawing by Goltzius of 1591 (Teylers Museum, Haarlem). He speculated that the portrait might be by Pietro Tacca. There is also a close relationship with the small bronze busts convincingly proposed by Charles Avery as portraits of Giambologna of which there are examples in the Rijksmuseum and the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon, and in the collection of Sir John Pope-Hennessy (C. Avery and A. Radcliffe (eds.), Giambologna, 1529-1608: Sculptor to the Medici (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1978), 168, nos. 143-5).
In 1964 the Ashmolean's bust was displayed with a label attributing it to Leone Leoni and suggesting that the sitter was Philip II of Spain. Pope-Hennessy, then Keeper of Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum, urged that this should be changed. An association with Giambologna obviously exists but 'the poor state of preservation does not permit a positive identification of its author' (C. Avery, Giambologna (Oxford, 1987), 277, no. 203).",,catalogue text,en

48. Alessandro Volta
66 cms. (height including integral plinth)
Bronze with a dark green and brown patina and a slightly granular surface. Hollow, lost-wax, cast. In the sloping moulding at the front of the plinth 'A VOLTA' (with the 'A' and 'V' interlaced) is incised in the model (with conspicuous burr) and to proper left side of the same moulding in smaller letters ‘GRANDI' is chiselled in the metal.
Sotheby's, London, 21-2 March 1985, lot 296 bought (hammer price £900) by Anthony Roth. Bought for £1,800 from Mr Roth in January 1986 with funds from the Madan Bequest.
Conte Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) was one of the greatest scientists of his age. The volt is named after him. The bronze, which perhaps records a sketch for a projected public statue, probably dates from the 1870s. Carlo Bozzi (in ‘Artisti contemporanei: Guiseppe Grandi', Emporium, 16 (1902), 91-108) refers to 'Il Volta pure così pieno di carattere e di vita, che vale un monumento e chi si vuole sia stato improvvisato nel marmo' and reproduces a statuette presumably in clay or plaster corresponding to this bronze but with more obvious tooling in the folds of the coat (ibid. 99). R. Boccardi ('Giuseppe Grandi', Rassegna d'arte, 21 (1921), 201) refers to a 'statuina in marmo' and reproduces the same work. No version in any material other than bronze, and no other version in bronze, has been traced, but the figure was reproduced as no. 681, pl. c in the catalogue of the 'Manifattura di Signa. Terre cotte aristiche e decorative' which had show-rooms c.1910 in Rome, Turin, and Paris.
Grandi was perhaps influenced by the brief popular biography by Luigi Alfonso Girardi (I contemporanei italiani: Galleria Nazionale del Secolo XIX (Turin, 1861)) in which the solitary walks which Volta took on the city walls of Pavia in the last decade of his life and the gravity of his deportment, the artless neglect of his dress, and his broad, albeit corrugated, brow are memorably sketched. He must also have consulted the marble bust by G. B. Comolli dated 1828 (Museo d'Arte Moderna, Milan). If there was a plan for a statue to him (and it was a period in which statues of almost every eminent Italian, ancient and modern, were projected) then it would have been likely to have been for Pavia, where Volta became professor in 1775, rather than for his native Como where there was already a statue of him by Pompeo Marchesi.
Grandi first attracted public notice by winning the competition for the monument to Cesare Beccaria (Palazzo di Giustizia, Milan) signed in 1870 and unveiled on 19 March 1871 in Palazzo di Giustizia, Milan (the marble figure is now in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan, no. 1111, and has been replaced by a bronze replica). The bozzetto for the figure was cast in bronze (examples are in the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome and the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan) and so too was his sketch, dated 1880, for a statue of Marshal Ney. These are both smaller than the bronze of Volta, but of similar patina and finish and with a similar plinth. The Ney would seem to have been cast in a large edition-- versions are in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan, in the David Daniels Collection (exhibited Minneapolis, 1979–80, no. 63, previously Shepherd Gallery, New York, 1974), and two have appeared in recent years with London dealers. All three statuettes, but especially that of Volta, possess a dynamic plasticity and an exaggerated, almost grotesque, characterization suggestive of developments in France of which Grandi knew nothing: Daumier's earlier Ratapoil (No. 274) and Rodin's later Balzac (No. 309) both come to mind.
In 1881 Grandi won the competition for the huge bronze monument in Milan commemorating the Cinque giornate the popular uprising of 19-23 March 1848 against Austrian rule-for which he completed the half-size model in 1886 and which was only just completed in bronze when he died. To this work, perhaps the most powerful and original public monument of the second half of the nineteenth century in Europe, he devoted most of the last fourteen years of his life For the influence of his ornamental designs and novel ideas for bust sculpture which he had pioneered in the 1870s see No. 83. The Ashmolean's statuette of Volta is the only work by Grandi on public view in this country with the exception of the extraordinary Kaled, al mattino del conflitto di Lara (Il paggio di Lara) of 1872 which stands in a high niche on the street front of no. 193 Fleet Street in London-'una meraviglia di vita e insieme un magnifico, secentistico, esempio di modellatura spigliata e di insieme decorativo, ma che, esposto a Brera [in 1873], ancora peggio che incomplet procurò al Grandi tali amarezze' (Bozzi, op. cit. 98).",,catalogue text,en

49. Saturn devouring an infant boy
21.5 cms. (height including integral pedestal); 4 cms. (height of integral pedestal); 6.9 cms. (length of pedestal); 4.1 cms. (width of pedestal); 2.8 cms. (height of modern plinth)
Probably lime, highly varnished-the varnish has given the wood a redder appearance than normal and has darkened in the hollows. The group is carved from two pieces. The vertical join may be discerned down the check of Saturn and the sides of his body: his right leg and left arm are fashioned for the most part from one block and left leg and right arm from the other. There is a slight split in the lower left leg. 'Antonio Gusela/Sculto."" de Belluno' is written in black ink in an old hand in a hollowed-out area behind the pedestal. The long 's' is easily read as a 'g' or 'z' and the next letter could be a 'z', 'a', or 'e'. 'M 232' is written in pen with black ink on the back of the hour-glass and on the base of the pedestal to proper right. The group has been mounted on an unmoulded mahogany plinth.
Bequeathed by J. Francis Mallett who died 7 January 1947. Received in the Museum during the last week of May 1947. No. 232 in the inventory of his bequest (as a work by 'Gugela'). Valued by Mallett at £10. Acquired by him from 'Christie 1937'.
The group looks as if it might be derived from a bronze statuette, but it is obviously not designed to be seen from behind. The shape of the pedestal suggests that it must date from the first half of the seventeenth century or later (compare the socle of Dieussart's bust of Prince Rupert, No. 471), but it could certainly be an eighteenth-century work. The little brackets incorporated into the front of the pedestal to accommodate the projections of the feet are an unusual feature. Belluno, in the Venetian Alps, was noted for its native wood-carving. It was the birthplace of Andrea Brustolon (1662–1732), much of whose work may be seen there. Among Brustolon's pupils listed in a document of 1722 is Giovanni Battista Alchini known as Gusela. This Gusela was noted as a carver of frames. Among works by him are the Madonna del Carmine in the church of Loreto in Belluno and a crucifix in the collection of the Avvocato A. da Borso also in that city (G. Biasuz and M. G. Buttignon, Andrea Brustolon (Padua, 1969), 14, 307 n.). Antonio Gusela is likely to have belonged to the same family.
Dr John Brazier who identified the wood as probably lime noted that it might be a fruit wood. It has previously been described as box.",,catalogue text,en

After François LADATTE (Francesco Ladetti or Ladetto) (1706-87)
50. Judith with the head of Holofernes
39.7 cms. (height); 17.6 cms. (length of integral plinth); 15.6 cms. (width of plinth excluding projection of sandal)
Bronze with a ruddy brown artificial patina simulating the natural patina of a coppery bronze, worn to reveal a yellow metal in some salient areas, notably the chin, nose, and hair. Hollow, sand, cast in three pieces, the sword with the drapery caught up by it forming one subsidiary unit and the heroine's right arm another. To proper right of the plinth on the side '2480' is stamped in the metal.
Bought in Paris in 1965, apparently on 14 September, from the Heim Gallery.
Ladatte exhibited a terracotta of Judith at the Paris salon in 1738 (no. 159) and another in the following year. The latter was the model for his marble version of 1741 (Musée du Louvre) which was his morceau de réception at the French Academy where he was nominated professor in 1743, the year before he returned to his native Turin. The terracotta, 84 cms. high, acquired 1981 by the Musées d'Art et d'Histoire de Chambéry may be the statuette of 1739. A gilded terracotta in the Museo Civico, Turin (pl. 13 of L. Mallè, ""Traccia per Francesco Ladatte, scultore torinese', in D. Fraser, H. Hibbard, and M. Levine (eds.), Essays in the History of Art Presented to Rudolf Wittkower (London, 1967), 242–54), which differs in many minor details-the treatment of the belt, the drapery over the sword hilt, the heroine's hand in the hair of her victim's head-may reflect another model, and may even be by Ladatte himself if the loss of sharpness is explained by the ground covering the terracotta preparatory to the gilding. The bronze in the Ashmolean is a reduced copy of the marble differing in that the sword hilt is not curved downwards in the bronze (someone may have supposed that the curve was due to a clay model sagging and have corrected it) and in many small details, the texturing of the sash (far more subtle in the marble) and the treatment of the eyes (deeply drilled in the marble), for instance. Ian Robertson bought it as a work by Ladatte himself, who was indeed noted for his bronzes, but the type of cast and its assembly are typical of Parisian foundries in the last century and the work is mechanical, without any of the vitality of either modelling or tooling that is found in works by Ladatte himself, such as the clock surrounded by allegories of Time and military glory, or the harpy furniture mounts and the candelabra in the Palazzo Reale, Turin (reproduced in A. N. Cellini, La scultura del settecento (Turin, 1982), 206, 217, 220). Ladatte is a sculptor little represented in British collections but the ormolu mounts on the fantastic mother- of-pearl stand in the Victoria and Albert Museum (W. 34- 1946) attributed to Pietro Piffetti can be attributed to him on account of the helmet revealing its quiited lining which is part of the trophy nestling in the cross stretchers-an identical helmet lining is found in the Judith and in the terracotta group of the Triumph of Virtue of 1744 (Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, inv. 6313).",,catalogue text,en
