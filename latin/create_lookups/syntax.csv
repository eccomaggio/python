*[1.i] Used with the indicative, the conjunction <cum> means "at that time when", or "whenever": <cum tacent, clāmant> (Cicero) —"when they are silent, (it is as if) they are shouting"
*[1.ii] Used with the subjunctive, however, <cum> frequently means "at a time when".
*[1.iii] When <cum> is used with the Imperfect subjunctive, a common way of translating it is "while": <cum sedērem domī trīstis, accurrit Venerius> (Cicero) — "while I was sitting sadly at home, Venerius suddenly came running up"
*(1.iv] With the Pluperfect subjunctive, <cum> often means "after X happened": <cum excessisset Aegyptō Antiochus, lēgātī ... Cyprum nāvigant> (Livy) — "after Antiochus had left Egypt, the ambassadors sailed to Cyprus"
*[1.v] <Cum> can also mean "in view of the fact that" or "since": <quae cum ita sint> "in view of the fact that these things are so" / "since this is so"
*[1.vi] Another, less common, meaning of <cum> is "though" (often with <tamen> in the <cum>-clause): <nihil mē adiūvit, cum posset> (Cicero) — "he did nothing to help me, though (or: at a time when) he could have done"
*[2] In later Latin, quod with the subjunctive could substitute for the accusative and infinitive in indirect statement, though this did not become common until the second century AD: <et vīdit Deus quod esset bonum> (Vulgate Bible) — "and God saw that it was good"
*[3] Indirect questions expecting an answer yes or no can be introduced by <-ne> (<an>) or <num> ("whether", "if"): <quaesīvit ā mē vellemne sēcum in castra proficīscī> (Nepos) — "he asked me whether I wanted to go with him to the camp"; <pecūniam admōvit ad nārēs, scīscitāns num odōre offenderētur> (Suetonius) — "he held the money under Titus's nose, asking if he was offended by the smell"
*[4] Most verbs of ordering, persuading, and encouraging are followed by <ut> (<utī>) "that" or <nē> "that not" and a subjunctive mood verb. This construction is common after verbs such as <imperō> "I order", <rogō> "I ask", <petō> "I request", <moneō> "I advise", <persuādeō> "I persuade", <hortor> "I exhort" and others.
*[5] There is no future periphrastic form for the passive; use the present/imperfect and an adverb e.g. <cras>.

*Syntax: Sequence of Tenses in Indirect Statements (accusative and infinitive pattern)
[Main]	%	[Rel. time]	[Infin.]	%	[Translation]
[Pres]	<dicunt>	same time	present	<eum/se iuvare eam>	They say he is/they are helping her.
[Perf]	<dixerunt>	before	perfect	<eum/se iuvisse eam>	They said he/they helped her.
[Fut]	<dicent>	after	future	<eum/se iuturum/-i (esse) eam>	They say he/they would help her.
*[1] One verb, <sum> "I am" has its own future infinitive <fore>, which may be used instead of <futūrum esse>. The verb <possum> "I am able" on the other hand has no future infinitive or future participle.
*[2] The future participle combined with <fuisse>, which expresses a past or present potential ("would be doing" or "would have done"): <nisī dē viā fessus esset, continuō ad nōs ventūrum fuisse> (Cicero) — "(he said that) if he had not been tired from the journey, he would have come to us straightaway"
*[3] The infinitive is used only for the main verb in an indirect statement; any other verbs are changed into the subjunctive mood, using one of the past tenses if the context is past: <locum ubi esset facile inventūrōs> (Nepos) — "(he told them that) they would easily find the place where he was"
*[4] The main verb introducing indirect statements does not have to be a verb of speaking; it can also be any of a range of other verbs, such as <sēnsit> "he realised", <simulāvit> "he pretended", <cōnstat> "it is well known", <spērō> "I hope", <scrīpsit> "he wrote" and so on, which use the same construction.
*[5] Some verbs, principally the verb <iubeō> "I order" and its opposite <vetō> "I forbid", use the accusative and infinitive construction, often with a passive infinitive: <signum darī iubet> (Caesar) — "he ordered the signal to be given"

*The difference between the two sets of perfect tenses is sometimes one of time, the second set referring to an earlier time than the first, as in this example from Caesar which contains both kinds: <pōns, quī fuerat tempestāte interruptus, paene erat refectus> — "the bridge, which earlier on had been broken by a storm, had now almost been rebuilt"

*Syntax: conditional (if) clauses with open, ideal & unreal conditions. (Protasis & apodosis)
*Conditional clauses in Latin are clauses which start with the conjunction <sī> "if" or the equivalent. The if-clause in a conditional sentence is known as the protasis, and the consequence is called the apodosis.
*Conditional clauses are generally divided into three types: open conditions, when the truth of the condition is unknown ("if it is true that…"); ideal conditions, in which the speaker imagines a situation or event which might occur in the future ("if this were to happen…"); and unreal conditions, referring to an event or situation in the present or past known to be contrary to fact ("if it were true that…"). These three are also sometimes referred to as Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 respectively.
*Open conditional clauses in turn can be divided into particular and general. Open conditional sentences generally use the indicative mood in both protasis and apodosis, although in some general conditions the subjunctive mood is used in the protasis. Ideal and unreal conditionals use the subjunctive in the protasis, and usually they also use the subjunctive in the apodosis, though sometimes the indicative may be used. Conditional clauses of comparison ("as if") also use the subjunctive mood in the protasis.
*The conjunction <sī> is only rarely used in classical Latin to introduce indirect questions, although this usage is found in medieval Latin. The use of "if" to make a wish, found in ancient Greek, is not usual in Latin, except sometimes in poetry.
*A difference from English grammar is that in open future conditions, it is usual in Latin to use one of the future tenses, when English has the present tense.

[Unreal (past)]	If it had happened then	pluperfect / imperfect SUBJ	pluperfect / imperfect SUBJ
%	%	<Si: id fe:cisset,>	<pru:dens fuisset.>
*Positive conditions are shown by: <sīn> "but if" ( used for the second of two opposite conditions); <sīve ... sīve> (or Livy's preferred form: <seu ... seu>) "whether ... or"; <quod sī> "but if" or "if, however" can also introduce an alternative; <etsī, etiamsī (…tamen)> "although"; <etiam sī> (or <etiamsī>) "even if", "even though"; <siquidem> or <sī quidem> means "if indeed" or "if it's true that"; <sī modō> "if indeed" expresses doubt that the situation mentioned is in fact true; <sī quis>  "if anyone", <sī quid> "if anything", <sī quī>  "if any", <sī quisquam> "if anyone at all", <sī quicquam> "if anything at all", <sī quandō> "if at any time / if ever",  <sī quā> "if in any way".
*When the conditional clause is negative, there are various possibilities: <nisi> "if not/unless", <sī ... nōn> "if not",  <nī> "were it not that" and <sī minus> "otherwise".
